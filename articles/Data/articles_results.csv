Nov-20,"A new tech regulator will work to limit the power of Google, Facebook and other tech platforms, the government has announced, in an effort to ensure a level playing field for smaller competitors and a fair market for consumers.Under the plans, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will gain a dedicated Digital Markets Unit, empowered to write and enforce a new code of practice on technology companies which will set out the limits of acceptable behaviour.The code will only affect those companies deemed to have ?strategic market status?, though it has not yet been decided what that means, nor what restrictions will be imposed.The business secretary, Alok Sharma, said: ?Digital platforms like Google and Facebook make a significant contribution to our economy and play a massive role in our day-to-day lives ? whether it?s helping us stay in touch with our loved ones, share creative content or access the latest news.?But the dominance of just a few big tech companies is leading to less innovation, higher advertising prices and less choice and control for consumers. Our new, pro-competition regime for digital markets will ensure consumers have choice, and mean smaller firms aren?t pushed out.?The government?s plans come in response to an investigation from the CMA which began as a narrow look at the digital advertising industry, but was later broadened out to cover Google and Facebook?s dominance of the market. The code will seek to mediate between platforms and news publishers, for instance, to try to ensure they are able to monetise their content; it may also require platforms to give consumers a choice over whether to receive personalised advertising, or force them to work harder to improve how they operate with rival platforms.Andrea Coscelli, the chief executive of the CMA, welcomed the move. ?Only through a new pro-competition regulatory regime can we tackle the market power of tech giants like Facebook and Google and ensure that businesses and consumers are protected.?We will soon be providing advice to government on how this new regime should work, as requested earlier this year, and stand ready to support the setup of the Digital Markets Unit.?Oliver Dowden, the digital secretary, said: ?There is growing consensus in the UK and abroad that the concentration of power among a small number of tech companies is curtailing growth of the sector, reducing innovation and having negative impacts on the people and businesses that rely on them. It?s time to address that and unleash a new age of tech growth.?But in trying to impose strict terms on multinational companies, the UK may have an uphill battle on its hands. In France, for instance, digital tax payments levied on big tech have been seen by the US government as unfair discrimination, leading to threats of retaliatory tariffs on French goods such as handbags and cosmetics.""""",0.052913059,"market 0.0275, tech 0.0242, digital 0.0242, company 0.0177, platforms 0.0176, consumers 0.0176, facebook 0.0144, google 0.0143, government 0.0143, ensure 0.0143"
Nov-20,"Google is moving deeper into consumer finance.The tech giant will let users open bank accounts, pay friends and manage budgets through a new version of its Google Pay app rolling out Wednesday. The Mountain View, California-based company partnered with Citi and Stanford Federal Credit Union to launch the mobile bank accounts and said it plans to add 11 new partner institutions next year. Google Pay will also let users send peer-to-peer payments ? a feature that made PayPal?s Venmo and Square?s Cash App household names as people shift to digital payments during the pandemic.?Along with our bank partners, we were looking to make banking more relevant for the mobile-first generation,? Caesar Sengupta, general manager of payments at Google, told CNBC in a video interview. ?It will help our partners make banking more approachable to that generation, and not only make it more relevant, but make it more fun.?Google?s announcement is the latest move into finance by Big Tech. Rival Apple launched its iPhone-integrated credit card with Goldman Sachs last year. Facebook lets users make payments via Messenger in certain markets. Chinese conglomerates Alibaba and Tencent have become giants in payments and investing thanks to their mobile payments apps.Google said its ?Plex? checking and savings accounts have no monthly fees, overdraft charges or minimum balance requirements. Users can also request a physical debit card, which will run on Mastercard?s network. The Wall Street Journal reported that the partnership was in the works last year.The new version of Google Pay looks like and borrows some features from Google?s other popular products, according to Sengupta. Users can link Google photos to search receipts and link Gmail to see bills and subscriptions for money management. It shows spending summaries, and trends over time. Users also get rewards and offers based on their transaction information.Banking Gen ZFor the banks, these tech partnerships can be a way to quickly grow customer deposits. Anand Selva, CEO of U.S. consumer banking at Citi, said it would help the retail side of the bank build out national scale and attract a new demographic.?It?s going to have a broad appeal, but especially among the younger population, Gen Z, that are more tech-driven and mobile-focused,? Selva said.One potential risk for banks is that tech companies will own the customer relationship and branding in these deals, keeping a lucrative part of the deal. Still, Selva said customers know Citi is the one holding the deposits.?The account is a Citi product, but customers get the best of both worlds with the Google ecosystem,? he said. The ?traditional banking model is evolving? and partnerships are becoming a key part of the industry?s future, Selva said.The new line of business comes as Google and other tech companies are under fire over their main profit engines: advertising. In October, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Google alleging that the company has unlawfully maintained a monopoly in search by cutting off rivals. A report by a congressional committee also alleged that Google used data collected from its operating system Android and browser Chrome for use in its other areas of business.Google said it will use certain data on the payments product, which it said is required by most mobile payment providers. For example, Google uses personal information to set up and maintain Google Pay account. Certain information is also required by regulators to protect against fraud and money laundering. ?Google Pay will never sell your data to third parties or share your transaction history with the rest of Google for targeting ads,? the company said.",0.162243506,"google 0.0430, bank 0.0265, payments 0.0172, make 0.0148, users 0.0148, tech 0.0148, mobile 0.0125, company 0.0124, account 0.0124"
Nov-20,"After five years of offering unlimited free photo backups at ?high quality,? Google Photos will start charging for storage once more than 15 gigs on the account have been used. The change will happen on June 1st, 2021, and it comes with other Google Drive policy changes like counting Google Workspace documents and spreadsheets against the same cap. Google is also introducing a new policy of deleting data from inactive accounts that haven?t been logged in to for at least two years.All photos and documents uploaded before June 1st will not count against that 15GB cap, so you have plenty of time to decide whether to continue using Google Photos or switching to another cloud storage provider for your photos. Only photos uploaded after June 1st will begin counting against the cap.Google already counts ?original quality? photo uploads against a storage cap in Google Photos. However, taking away unlimited backup for ?high quality? photos and video (which are automatically compressed for more efficient storage) also takes away one of the service?s biggest selling points. It was the photo service where you just didn?t have to worry about how much storage you had.As a side note, Pixel owners will still be able to upload high-quality (not original) photos for free after June 1st without those images counting against their cap. It?s not as good as the Pixel?s original deal of getting unlimited original quality, but it?s a small bonus for the few people who buy Google?s devices.Google points out that it offers more free storage than others ? you get 15GB instead of the paltry 5GB that Apple?s iCloud gives you ? and it also claims that 80 percent of Google Photos users won?t hit that 15GB cap for at least three years.The company will send alerts and warnings when you begin to approach that cap. Google is also putting new storage management tools into Google Photos, including a tool that makes it easier to find and delete photos you might not want anyway, like blurry images or screenshots.Google is also going to show a more useful ?personalized estimate? of how much longer a storage tier will last in terms of time instead of gigabytes. It estimates each user?s average uploads over time to guess how much longer they?ll be able to use their current tier.Why the change? One possibility is that it?s part of a larger push to get more people to sign up for Google One storage. The service now also includes a free VPN for Android at some of its higher tiers, and it seems as though many Google products are aligning with Google One. Google?s explanation in a brief interview is simpler: there is already a nearly unfathomable number of photos and videos uploaded to Google Photos, and the service needs to be sustainable. That?s the gist if you read between the lines of its blog post:Today, more than 4 trillion photos are stored in Google Photos, and every week 28 billion new photos and videos are uploaded. Since so many of you rely on Google Photos to store your memories, it?s important that it?s not just a great product, but also continues to meet your needs over the long haul. In order to welcome even more of your memories and build Google Photos for the future, we are changing our unlimited High quality storage policy. Google One pricing is not changing. It starts at $1.99 / month for 100GB and has tiers going through 200GB ($2.99 / month), 2TB ($9.99 / month), and all the way up to 30TB ($149.99 / month).Alongside photos, ?Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Drawings, Forms and Jamboard files? will also begin counting against storage caps. The reasoning is ?to bring our policies more in line with industry standards,? Google says. (This puts an end to some very clever hacks like this one that turned files into Google Docs through a binary conversion tool.)As for the inactive account policy, it seems fairly reasonable: if you haven?t touched your Google account for two years and don?t respond in any way to the multiple warning emails and notifications Google sends you, the company may delete data from your account. Here?s how Google explains it:If you?re inactive in one or more of these services for two years (24 months), Google may delete the content in the product(s) in which you?re inactive. [...] Similarly, if you?re over your storage limit for two years, Google may delete your content across Gmail, Drive and Photos.We will notify you multiple times before we attempt to remove any content so you have ample opportunities to take action. The simplest way to keep your account active is to periodically visit Gmail, Drive or Photos on the web or mobile, while signed in and connected to the internet.

Nov-20,"The European Union spent a decade pursuing Google on antitrust charges, ultimately fining the company nearly $10 billion for using illegal tactics to abuse its dominant position on the market.But two years after the bloc?s biggest rulings, very little competition has emerged, in part because the E.U. largely left it to Google to fix the problems, antitrust lawyers and Google competitors say.Google?s fixes included charging a fee to rival search engines that wanted to appear on a selection menu for Android phones, a step that drew howls of protest from competitors ? why should they have to pay Google to help it fix its anticompetitive behavior, they asked??The bad actor gets to decide what their medicine is going to be. And that?s just crazy, right?? Megan Gray, general counsel of rival search engine DuckDuckGo, said in an interview.With the Justice Department filing its own antitrust case against Google last month, U.S. government lawyers are scrutinizing the European results. Google continues to dominate more than 90 percent of Europe?s search-engine market, just as it did before the E.U. probes began in 2010, data from the analytics firm StatCounter show. Google competitors in the online shopping business, meanwhile, complain the playing field is still tilted in the tech giant?s favor.Some veterans of the E.U. battle say the outcome shows the difficulty of restoring competition to a market that has already tipped under the control of one giant. They also say the European Commission was held back by a belief that Europe didn?t have the political standing to impose tougher measures, such as a breakup, on an American company.?As a matter of politics, the European Commission is not going to break up an American icon. That just ain?t going to happen,? said Thomas Vinje, an antitrust lawyer at Clifford Chance who advises an industry group that helped spark the commission?s investigation by filing a complaint against Google. The group, FairSearch, is funded by Oracle, TripAdvisor and others.The Justice Department lawsuit hinted at possibly tougher measures, should the government win its case, asking the court to consider ?structural relief,? which theoretically could include a requirement that the company sell a portion of its business.?It?s more difficult to win a case in the U.S. than in Europe. However, the U.S. in the past has applied more far-reaching remedies, mandating divestitures and breakups,? said Gene Kimmelman, former chief counsel for the Justice Department?s antitrust division, who now serves as senior adviser to the nonprofit tech-policy group Public Knowledge.In a blog post after the U.S. filed its lawsuit, Kent Walker, Google?s senior vice president of global affairs, said consumers ?use Google because they choose to, not because they?re forced to, or because they can?t find alternatives.? He called the Justice Department case ?deeply flawed? and said it ?would do nothing to help consumers.?Google spokesman Jose Castaneda disputed the idea that the European Commission investigations have changed nothing, saying the bloc?s probe of Google?s role in the online shopping market led the tech giant to make changes that are ?subject to intensive monitoring? and ?generating billions of clicks for more than 600 comparison shopping services.?He declined to comment on Google?s continued dominance of general search queries. Google is appealing the E.U. rulings.A spokeswoman for the European Commission, which also announced antitrust charges against Amazon on Tuesday, said the bloc ?continues monitoring the market with a view to assessing the effectiveness of the remedies"" applied in the Google case.She added that the commission plans to propose new legislation to the European Parliament to help ?address more effectively? competition problems in the tech sector.Margrethe Vestager, who oversees competition policy at the commission, has said the bloc is considering proposing powers that would give it more flexibility to address ?structural competition problems.?The E.U.?s former chief competition economist, who was involved in the Google cases, summed up the lackluster result with a rueful joke on Twitter last month.?How it started, how it?s going,? Tommaso Valletti tweeted, atop two slides: the E.U.?s 2010 announcement opening an antitrust investigation into Google and a chart showing the tech giant continuing to monopolize the search-engine market ever since.Rivals Bing, Yahoo, Yandex and DuckDuckGo have held steady with a small sliver of the market, according to StatCounter data.U.S. federal and state prosecutors have closely studied Europe?s pursuit of Google to try to draw lessons. Last year, a group of state attorneys general investigating the tech giant hired an adviser with long-running ties to one of the E.U. probes: Cristina Caffarra, a Britain-based economist and consultant who previously advised Yandex, a Russian tech company whose complaints about Google helped kick off one E.U. investigation. Caffarra in the past also advised Google critic News Corp.?When I started advising the AGs last year, I had my first meeting with them in Austin,? Caffarra said in an interview. One of their big questions about the E.U. campaign was, ?Why hasn?t it worked?? she said.Caffarra said she explained some of the ?limitations? of the European response, including that it gave Google the power to design its own remedies. ?The state AGs were all looking at me, saying, ?We are the government. We can break them up.??Many of the allegations in the Justice Department?s 60-page lawsuit mirror the findings of the E.U.?s biggest probe: that Google used illegal tactics to ensure its search engine and apps were widely adopted by phone manufacturers and mobile-network operators, which often determine the specs of phones used in their networks.The commission?s probe, which ended in 2018, found that Google required Android phone manufacturers to pre-install Google?s search engine and the Chrome browser app as a condition for licensing the Google Play app store, a feature no Android phone can do without. It also found that Google paid some phone manufacturers and mobile network operators in exchange for exclusively pre-installing Google Search.?These practices have denied rivals the chance to innovate and compete on the merits. They have denied European consumers the benefits of effective competition in the important mobile sphere,? the commission concluded.The E.U. fined Google $5.1 billion and ordered the company to cease its anti-competitive conduct within 90 days, but the commission essentially left it to Google to propose and adopt changes to remedy the infractions, lawyers say.The commission did informally push back on one of Google?s proposed remedies, when the tech giant suggested it tweak its contracts with phone manufacturers in a way the commission viewed as insufficient, Vinje said.But generally, the commission felt ?that it?s appropriate to leave it to companies to find their own means to deliver the end result,? said Alec Burnside, an antitrust lawyer at Dechert LLP in Brussels, who has represented several Google opponents in antitrust cases.The fixes Google did adopt changed little, said Gray, DuckDuckGo?s general counsel.?First, Google sent out an alert to all Android phones [in Europe], in the spring of 2019,? Gray said. ?It sent an alert saying, ?Hey, would you like another search engine? Click one of these other options.???With no context or background, it was a really weird alert. If you stopped in your tracks and paid attention ? and picked DuckDuckGo, it downloaded from the Play store the DuckDuckGo app,? she said. But that download didn?t change any of the phone?s default search-engine settings, so the effect was minimal, she said.Google also offered rivals the chance to bid for a spot in the search-engine choice menu for new phones running on Google?s Android software. Gray said rivals bristled at the idea of paying Google to help it ?correct its anti-competitive behavior.?Google said its offer was a ?fair and objective method to determine which search providers are included in the choice screen. It allows search providers to decide what value they place on appearing in the choice screen and to bid accordingly.?Google also said that if no rival search engines bid for the slots, it would randomly choose competitors to display free.After a separate probe, the E.U. in 2017 fined Google $2.8 billion, concluding it had ?abused its market dominance? to give an ?illegal advantage? in its search results to Google Shopping, the horizontal bar of product ads Google features at the top of the search results screen.The commission concluded that Google had demoted rival shopping sites that compare prices for various products, such as Foundem, a British company that helped spark the investigation by complaining to the commission that Google was unfairly suppressing its site in the search results.After the commission ordered Google to cease its anticompetitive behavior, Google offered companies such as Foundem the chance to bid for ad space in the Google Shopping bar.Foundem chief executive Shivaun Raff said the company has refused to bid for the ads, because that would harm consumers by featuring products that ?will pay Google the most money for a click.?Inside the commission, the Google cases are ?seen as failures,? said Damien Geradin, a lawyer in Brussels who regularly represents companies opposing Google in antitrust matters.?These are great decisions with great principles. I think the Department of Justice can find great information there,? Geradin said. ?But at the end of the day the remedies were not there.??In a way the best thing that could happen in the E.U. would be for the U.S. action to succeed,? he said.",0.074114108,"google 0.0490, search 0.0168, commission 0.0165, phone 0.0101, company 0.0101, antitrust 0.0100, european 0.0089, market 0.0082, engine 0.0082"
Nov-20,"After two long, complicated years, every Android user worldwide (outside China and Russia) now has access to the next-gen texting standard that is replacing SMS. Google is directly offering RCS chat services through its Android Messages app to anybody who installs it and uses it as their default texting app, which partly bypasses a carrier rollout that, at times, has ranged from sluggish to incoherent to broken.Just as importantly, Google has announced that it?s finally beginning to enable a key privacy feature: end-to-end encryption. For Android users who use Android Messages, one-on-one chats will eventually be end-to-end encrypted by default, meaning neither carriers nor Google will be able to read the content of those messages.Even though encryption is only beginning to roll out to people who sign up for the public beta for Android Messages, turning on encryption for RCS is a very big deal. It?s a massive privacy win, as it could mean that the de facto replacement for SMS will, by default, be private on the smartphone platform used by the vast majority of people worldwide.As for the people who use that other smartphone platform ? the iPhone ? we have no word on whether Apple intends to adopt the RCS standard. But as every carrier worldwide gets on board, and now that there is a clearer path to ensuring private communication with RCS, the pressure on Apple to participate is likely to build.Unfortunately, SMS becoming fully deprecated and replaced by RCS will only happen if all goes to plan for Google. Since initially announcing plans to transition to RCS as the primary texting platform for Android, the standard?s rollout has been mired in confusion. In attempting to be neutral and make Android?s texting a standard shared by carriers worldwide, Google set itself up with the job of herding multibillion-dollar cats ? with sadly predictable results.However, last year, Google began to take matters into its own hands, slowly letting users in different countries get RCS services directly from Google rather than wait for their carrier to turn it on. (Even when carriers did turn it on, it has often not been interoperable.)Today, the company has announced that process is complete and RCS is available through Android Messages everywhere Google offers its services (i.e., not China). In certain regions and with certain carriers, Google will continue to allow those carriers to run your RCS services if they so choose.Worldwide availability is an important milestone, but to me, the fact that Google is building on top of RCS to eventually make Android Messages end-to-end encrypted by default is the much bigger news. So let?s get into how exactly it will work because there are some things to be aware of.First, as mentioned, it will be rolling out in beta this month, and Google has no timeline for when encrypted chats will graduate into the main app. And as for people willing to sign up for the public beta of Android Messages, be aware that, as usual, Google will be rolling out the feature gradually, so you might not get it right away.End-to-end encryption will only work on one-on-one chats when both users are using Android Messages and have received the update. Enabling end-to-end encryption on group chats is a much trickier problem, so Google won?t commit to a timeline for extending the feature.Android Messages on the web is simply a portal to the messaging app on your phone, so just like Signal and WhatsApp, texts you send in that interface will also be encrypted. Speaking of Signal, Google has selected the Signal Protocol for its encryption implementation ? just like WhatsApp. (The Signal Protocol is simply the code used to secure the messages; it does not mean those apps can interoperate.)If you are texting with somebody who isn?t using Android Messages (say, somebody using Samsung Messages or an iPhone), the fallback to either less-encrypted RCS chat or SMS will still work just fine. And since Android Messages? more advanced features are all built into the app instead of living in the cloud, turning on encryption shouldn?t break any other app experiences.The saga of getting carriers and various other business interests aligned on an RCS standard is ongoing. That standard is called the Universal Profile, and it is still evolving as I write this. One thing that isn?t part of the Universal Profile is the encryption standard Google is adopting. It?s building it on top of RCS right into the Android Messages client.That doesn?t mean Google intends for its encryption solution to be proprietary. The company tells me it would be happy to work with any company to work on compatibility. Google has published a brief technical paper available that provides a high-level overview of Google?s method for encryption in Android Messages.In other words, it may well be that Google?s encryption implementation could someday become part of the Universal Profile standard. As with Apple, there could be some pressure put on the GSMA (the carrier consortium) to move toward more encryption. Facebook still intends to make all of its messaging apps encrypted by default, so it is increasingly becoming a norm for texting. (Disclosure: my wife works for Facebook Reality Labs, the AR / VR division of the company. Read my full ethics statement here.)As with all things RCS, it?s better to think of today?s announcements as part of an evolving process rather than a launch. Many things in tech have big, splashy moments where products become immediately available and start having an impact right away. RCS is not one of those things.",0.132741638,"google 0.0352, message 0.0317, android 0.0298, encryption 0.0224, standard 0.0152, use 0.0116, carriers 0.0116, encrypt 0.0116, chat 0.0116, work 0.0115"
Nov-20,"Google Maps knows everything. Not just about every street, and every cafe, bar and shop on that street, but the people who go to them. With 1 billion monthly active users, the app is embedded in people?s lives ? directing them on their commute, to their friends? and families? homes, to doctor?s appointments and on their travels abroad. The fact that Google Maps has the power to follow your every step doesn't automatically mean it?s misusing that power. But they could, which is an issue in and of itself, especially since Google?s headquarters are in the US, where privacy legislation is looser than in Europe and intelligence agencies have a history of surveilling private citizens (I see you, NSA).  Yes, Google Maps is incredibly useful. But here are just a few reasons to double check your privacy settings and ask yourself how much personal data you?re willing to sacrifice in the name of convenience.Google Maps Wants Your Search HistoryGoogle?s ?Web & App Activity? settings describe how the company collects data, such as user location, to create a faster and ?more personalised? experience. In plain English, this means that every single place you?ve looked up in the app ? whether it?s a strip club, a kebab shop or your moped-riding drug dealer?s location ? is saved and integrated into Google's search engine algorithm for a period of 18 months.Google knows you probably find this creepy. That?s why the company uses so-called ""dark patterns"" ? user interfaces crafted to coax us into choosing options we might not otherwise, for example by highlighting an option with certain fonts or brighter colours.VICE created a new Google account for this piece, to see how difficult it would be for a new user to avoid the dark patterns. After pushing the ?Create Account? button, we were served a pop-up saying the account was ?set up to include personalisation features? in small grey letters, with a much larger blue button saying ?Confirm?. By clicking ?Confirm?, we would have consented to the ""Web & App Activity"" settings mentioned above. The alternative was the less visible ""More options"" button, which opened a new page with long and complicated explanations. Then we still had to manually deactivate the ""Web & App Activity"" settings to opt out. We sent the Google press office a list of 12 questions, and a spokeswoman replied saying Google wants its settings to be easy to find and use. She said the settings were carefully developed and that Google is open to feedback. She also went into more detail about our questions, but did not want to be quoted.Google Maps Limits Its Features If You Don?t Share Your Search HistoryIf you open your Google Maps app, you?ll see a circle in the top right corner that signifies you?re logged in with your Google account. That?s not necessary, and you can simply log out. Of course, the log out button is slightly hidden, but can be found like this: click on the circle > Settings > scroll down > Log out of Google Maps.Unfortunately, Google Maps won?t let you save frequently visited places if you?re not logged into your Google account. If you choose not to log in, when you click on the search bar you get a ""Tired of typing?"" button, suggesting you sign in, and coaxing you towards more data collection.Google Maps Can Snitch On YouAnother problematic feature is the ""Google Maps Timeline"", which ?shows an estimate of places you may have been and routes you may have taken based on your Location History?. With this feature, you can look at your personal travel routes on Google Maps, including the means of transport you probably used, such as a car or a bike. The obvious downside is that your every move is known to Google, and to anyone with access to your account. And that?s not just hackers ? Google may also share data with government agencies such as the police. On its FAQ page for this topic, Google says its legal team evaluates each case individually. Every six months, the company releases a transparency report, although nothing is available for 2020. Between July and December of 2019, Google received 81,785 requests affecting 175,715 accounts worldwide, and disclosed information in the majority of the cases, and 74 percent in May of 2019.If your ?Location History? is on, your phone ?saves where you go with your devices, even when you aren't using a specific Google service?, as is explained in more detail on this page. This feature is useful if you lose your phone, but also turns it into a bonafide tracking device.Google Maps Wants to Know Your HabitsReviews on Google can be super helpful, but a quick search can reveal sensitive information mindlessly left by reviewers. Just one example is a user who (seemingly using their real name) wrote the following review about a Berlin supermarket: ""I?ve been going there two or three times a week for the past four years both to shop for my family or on my walk after dinner.? Needless to say, sharing this kind of information with the whole world can be risky.Google Maps often asks users to share a quick public rating. ""How was Berlin Burger? Help others know what to expect,"" suggests the app after you?ve picked up your dinner. This feels like a casual, lighthearted question and relies on the positive feeling we get when we help others. But all this info is collected in your Google profile, making it easier for someone to figure out if you?re visiting a place briefly and occasionally (like on holiday) or if you live nearby.If you do end up regretting a review, at least Google gives you the option to make your reviews private after you?ve posted them. The unintuitive path goes: Profile icon> Your profile > Edit profile > Profile and privacy settings > Scroll down > Restricted profile. If you enable this, you?ll need to approve who can follow your profile and see your reviews. Google Maps Doesn?t Like It When You?re OfflineRemember GPS navigation? It might have been clunky and slow, but it?s a good reminder that you don?t need to be connected to the internet to be directed. In fact, other apps offer offline navigation. On Google, you can download maps, but offline navigation is only available for cars. It seems fairly unlikely the tech giant can?t figure out how to direct pedestrians and cyclists without internet.Google Makes It Seem Like This Is All for Your Own Good""Providing useful, meaningful experiences is at the core of what Google does,? the company says on its website, adding that knowing your location is important for this reason. They say they use this data for all kinds of useful things, like ?security? and ?language settings? ? and, of course, selling ads. Google also sells advertisers the possibility to evaluate how well their campaigns reached their target (that?s you!) and how often people visited their physical shops ?in an anonymised and aggregated manner?. But only if you opt in (or you forget to opt out).There are alternatives to Google Maps, but none are as goodSometimes, there are good alternatives to problematic apps. That?s true for WhatsApp, for example, but not for Google Maps. Apple Maps has stricter privacy features, but it?s not available for Android. Apps like Here WeGo and OsmAnd still collect data and just aren?t as good ? but if you?re a walker who prefers to stay offline, OsmAnd and Maps.me can at least show you the way without connecting to the internet.",0.078586551,"google 0.0510, map 0.0264, settings 0.0127, profile 0.0100, like 0.0100, account 0.0100, every 0.0087, data 0.0086, know 0.0086"

If you've been working remotely for any length of time, you know how nice that sounds.Pichai's memo to employees describes the reason this way:Some of our teams have also held ""no meetings weeks,"" which create space for Googlers to either focus on independent work, or make it easier to switch off entirely and take a vacation. We've decided to make December 28, 2020 to January 1, 2021 an official no meetings week across the company. Of course, there will be exceptions for teams that are working to hit hard deadlines, closing deals, or supporting critical infrastructure (please watch for guidance from your leadership). Otherwise, let's move or cancel all routine and non-critical meetings that week.˜It's a simple and effective way to help give your team a gift of time, and to help them clear their schedule of meetings. As someone who has worked remotely for years, I can say that it truly does feel like a gift.There are many advantages to working from home, but one of the bigger challenges is that managers have a tendency to think they need to replace the physical proximity of working together in an office with a lot of face-to-face time on screen. That means that many remote workers have been spending a lot of time in video meetings.That is exhausting.˜In fact,˜I'm in favor of less virtual meetings in general. I'm definitely a fan of setting a company-wide priority to give team members a week off from˜the constant stream of meetings, which˜often serve no other function than to interrupt whatever work your team is trying to accomplish anyway. If nothing else, you should absolutely steal this idea for your company, if you aren't doing it already.Furthermore, one of the things I love about Google's initiative is that it came from something that its teams were doing already. Often the very best ideas for taking care of your people come from those who are already responsible for doing just that.˜The other thing that's worth pointing out is that Google is giving teams the flexibility to adapt these initiatives in a way that best works for their group needs. To be honest, this might even be the more important thing you can take from Google's plan: It's up to leaders to˜give your employees space to rest and get away,˜and to allow them to do it in a way that actually fits their work.˜The best part is:˜It's as simple as three words˜you can use too.",0.241800292,"work 0.0362, company 0.0282, team 0.0255, meet 0.0255, time 0.0200, google 0.0173, give 0.0172, help 0.0145, take 0.0145, best 0.0119"
Nov-20,"PARIS (Reuters) - French technology firm OVH said on Tuesday it is partnering with Google to build up its capacities in cloud computing, leaning on the U.S. giant?s technology to speed up a push towards developing a European contender in the area.Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet?s Google dominate the field of data storage worldwide, which has fuelled calls from politicians in Europe for homegrown alternatives to rise to the challenge of becoming credible rivals.Some have positioned the storage of sensitive corporate and state data as a matter of sovereignty and national security.OVH and Dassault Systemes are two of the companies in France that have been racing to develop their businesses amid warnings from ministers that Europe was already well behind.OVH said in a statement that its partnership with Google Cloud would allow it to bring some of the U.S. firm?s technology into services which its teams would operate and run in Europe.?Listening to our customers, partners and policymakers in Europe, we understand their need for even greater control and autonomy,? Google Cloud?s Chief Executive Thomas Kurian said in the same statement.The two firms did not disclose any financial details.",0.125,"europe 0.0324, google 0.0323, technology 0.0250, firm 0.0249, cloud 0.0249, partner 0.0175, would 0.0175, storage 0.0175, data 0.0175"
Nov-20,"Google has one of the largest machine learning stacks in the industry, currently centering on its Google Cloud AI and Machine Learning Platform. Google spun out TensorFlow as open source years ago, but TensorFlow is still the most mature and widely cited deep learning framework. Similarly, Google spun out Kubernetes as open source years ago, but it is still the dominant container management system.Google is one of the top sources of tools and infrastructure for developers, data scientists, and machine learning experts, but historically Google AI hasn?t been all that attractive to business analysts who lack serious data science or programming backgrounds. That?s starting to change.The Google Cloud AI and Machine Learning Platform includes AI building blocks, the AI platform and accelerators, and AI solutions. The AI solutions are fairly new and aimed at business managers rather than data scientists. They may include consulting from Google or its partners.The AI building blocks, which are pre-trained but customizable, can be used without intimate knowledge of programming or data science. Nevertheless, they are often used by skilled data scientists for pragmatic reasons, essentially to get stuff done without extensive model training.The AI platform and accelerators are generally for serious data scientists, and require coding skill, knowledge of data preparation techniques, and lots of training time. I recommend going there only after trying the relevant building blocks.There are still some missing links in Google Cloud?s AI offerings, especially in data preparation. The closest thing Google Cloud has to a data import and conditioning service is the third-party Cloud Dataprep by Trifacta; I tried it a year ago and was underwhelmed. The feature engineering built into Cloud AutoML Tables is promising, however, and it would be useful to have that sort of service available for other scenarios.The seamy underside of AI has to do with ethics and responsibility (or the lack thereof), along with persistent model biases (often because of biased data used for training). Google published its AI Principles in 2018. It?s a work in progress, but it?s a basis for guidance as discussed in a recent blog post on Responsible AI.There is lots of competition in the AI market (over a dozen vendors), and lots of competition in the public cloud market (over half-a-dozen credible vendors). To do the comparisons justice, I?d have to write an article at least five times as long as this one, so as much as I hate leaving them out, I?ll have to omit most product comparisons. For the top obvious comparison, I can summarize: AWS does most of what Google does, and is also very good, but generally charges higher prices.IDGGoogle Cloud?s AI building blocks don?t require much machine learning expertise, instead building on pre-trained models and automatic training. The AI Platform allows you to train and deploy your own machine learning and deep learning models.Google Cloud AI Building BlocksGoogle Cloud AI Building Blocks are easy-to-use components that you can incorporate into your own applications to add sight, language, conversation, and structured data. Many of the AI building blocks are pre-trained neural networks, but can be customized with transfer learning and neural network search if they don?t serve your needs out of the box. AutoML Tables is a little different, in that it automates the process a data scientist would use to find the best machine learning model for a tabular data set.AutoMLThe Google Cloud AutoML services provide customized deep neural networks for language pair translation, text classification, object detection, image classification, and video object classification and tracking. They require tagged data for training, but don?t require significant knowledge of deep learning, transfer learning, or programming.Google Cloud AutoML customizes Google?s battle-tested, high-accuracy deep neural networks for your tagged data. Rather than starting from scratch when training models from your data, AutoML implements automatic deep transfer learning (meaning that it starts from an existing deep neural network trained on other data) and neural architecture search (meaning that it finds the right combination of extra network layers) for language pair translation and the other services listed above.In each area, Google already has one or more pre-trained services based on deep neural networks and huge sets of labeled data. These may well work for your data unmodified, and you should test that to save yourself time and money. If they don?t do what you need, Google Cloud AutoML helps you to create a model that does, without requiring that you know how to perform transfer learning or how to design neural networks.Transfer learning offers two big advantages over training a neural network from scratch. First, it requires a lot less data for training, since most of the layers of the network are already well trained. Second, it trains a lot faster, since it?s only optimizing the final layers.While the Google Cloud AutoML services used to be presented together as a package, they are now listed with their base pre-trained services. What most other companies call AutoML is performed by Google Cloud AutoML Tables. IDGI tested an AutoML Vision custom flower classifier, which I trained in an hour from Google sample images, with a photo of tulips that I took at a nearby art museum.AutoML TablesThe usual data science process for many regression and classification problems is to create a table of data for training, clean and condition the data, perform feature engineering, and try to train all of the appropriate models on the transformed table, including a step to optimize the best models? hyperparameters. Google Cloud AutoML Tables can perform this entire process automatically once you manually identify the target field.AutoML Tables automatically searches through Google?s model zoo for structured data to find the best model for your needs, ranging from linear/logistic regression models for simpler data sets to advanced deep, ensemble, and architecture-search methods for larger, more complex ones. It automates feature engineering on a wide range of tabular data primitives ? such as numbers, classes, strings, timestamps, and lists ? and helps you detect and take care of missing values, outliers, and other common data issues.Its codeless interface guides you through the full end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, making it easy for anyone on your team to build models and reliably incorporate them into broader applications. AutoML Tables provides extensive input data and model behavior explainability features, along with guardrails to prevent common mistakes. AutoML Tables is also available in API and notebook environments.AutoML Tables competes with Driverless AI and several other AutoML implementations and frameworks.Google Cloud AutoML Tables automates the whole pipeline for creating predictive models for tabular data, from feature engineering through deployment.At the Analyze phase of AutoML Tables, you can see the descriptive statistics of all your original features.The free Google Cloud Vision ?Try the API? interface allowed me to drag a JPEG onto a web page and see the results. The child was smiling, so the ?Joy? tag is correct. The algorithm didn?t quite recognize the paper Pilgrim hat.Vision APIThe Google Cloud Vision API is a pre-trained machine learning service for categorizing images and extracting various features. It can classify images into thousands of pre-trained categories, ranging from generic objects and animals found in the image (such as a cat), to general conditions (for example, dusk), to specific landmarks (Eiffel Tower, Grand Canyon), and identify general properties of the image, such as its dominant colors. It can isolate areas that are faces, then apply geometric (facial orientation and landmarks) and emotional analyses to the faces, although it does not recognize faces as belonging to specific people, except for celebrities (which requires a special usage license). Vision API uses OCR to detect text within images in more than 50 languages and various file types. It can also identify product logos, and detect adult, violent, and medical content.Video Intelligence APIThe Google Cloud Video Intelligence API automatically recognizes more than 20,000 objects, places, and actions in stored and streaming video. It also distinguishes scene changes and extracts rich metadata at the video, shot, or frame level. It additionally performs text detection and extraction using OCR, detects explicit content, automates closed captioning and subtitles, recognizes logos, and detects faces, persons, and poses.Google recommends the Video Intelligence API for extracting metadata to index, organize, and search your video content. It can transcribe videos and generate closed captions, as well as flag and filter inappropriate content, all more cost-effectively than human transcribers. Use cases include content moderation, content recommendations, media archives, and contextual advertisements.IDGThe Google Cloud Natural Language API finds entities, sentiment, syntax, and categories. Here we see syntax diagrams for two sentences from a Google press release.Natural Language APINatural language processing (NLP) is a big part of the ?secret sauce? that makes input to Google Search and the Google Assistant work well. The Google Cloud Natural Language API exposes that same technology to your programs. It can perform syntax analysis (see the image below), entity extraction, sentiment analysis, and content classification, in 10 languages. You may specify the language if you know it; otherwise, the API will attempt to auto-detect the language. A separate API, currently available for early access on request, specializes in healthcare-related content.TranslationThe Google Cloud Translation API can translate over a hundred language pairs, can auto-detect the source language if you don?t specify it, and comes in three flavors: Basic, Advanced, and Media Translation. The Advanced Translation API supports a glossary, batch translation, and the use of custom models. The Basic Translation API is essentially what is used by the consumer Google Translate interface. AutoML Translation allows you to train custom models using transfer learning.The Media Translation API translates content directly from audio (speech), either audio files or streams, in 12 languages, and automatically generates punctuation.

Nov-20,"Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, Google has emphasized employee health, establishing long-term remote work plans and offering periodic days off called ?reset? days. Even that hasn?t been enough to deal with the mental stress caused by the virus.?Covid-19 is something we weren?t anticipating or frankly prepared for from a mental skills approach,? said Lauren Whitt, whose title at Google is wellness manager and resilience lead. She has a big job, ?helping Googlers meet the moment they?re facing today.?Whitt told CNBC in an interview that, in seeking out strategies to help Google?s 130,000-plus employees deal with the ongoing crisis, the company is leaning on ?resilience training,? a phrase typically reserved for professional athletes and combat fighters.The company said it has expanded existing programs and created weekly short instructional videos from athletes, coaches and psychologists, which employees are watching with greater frequency.Alphabet?s chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, who organized the early crisis response efforts, said last week that the company has rebounded after a dip in employee productivity. Her main concern today is with their mental wellness due both to isolation and the intensity of recent events.?One of the things we?re very concerned about is the wellness measures,? Porat said at The New York Times DealBook conference. ?What are some of the things we could do that helps ease the stress of working during a pandemic??For investors, Alphabet continues to perform. The stock is trading near a record, up 32% this year, compared with the 12% gain by the S&P 500. But the company?s vocal employee base has not been silent about the surrounding struggles, particularly at a time when they don?t have access to their usual campus amenities.Soon after the Covid-19 outbreak, the nation faced another crisis following the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota, which was caught on tape and sparked nationwide protests. The incident forced tech companies, including Google, to reckon with their own issues surrounding diversity and the treatment of minorities.?Summer led to a lot of discussions around social unrest and racial justice,? Whitt said. ?It is very real and a very prevalent part of our conversation of 2020.?She said that even with all the support groups and employees resources, ?more than anything, we?re encouraging Googlers to have conversations and to be authentic with who they are and what they?re feeling.?  As discussions got more heated, Google began asking employees to take a more active role in moderating internal message boards.?Tensions continue specifically for our Black+ community with Black Lives Matter, and our Asian Googlers with coronavirus and China/Hong Kong,? Google?s internal moderation team said in a blog post in September. ?All of this is compounded by the additional stress of working from home, social isolation, and caregiver responsibilities ? to name a few.?Meanwhile, Google made clear that there wouldn?t be a return to normalcy anytime soon.In July, Google became the first major company to announce it would allow employees the option to work from home through mid-2021, an extension of its prior timeline. Soon after, it began offering reset days so employees could take periodic time off to unplug.?In July and August, we realized this isn?t going away and we really began to shift the conversation to how to set new routines, how to change or alternate the environment they?re working in and focus on new skills and habits and routines,? Whitt said.Small habitsThe company?s resilience team, which had existing programs like counseling and employee resource groups, wanted to do more for mental well-being. But it faced a challenge. Employees were already stuck in front of their screens for too many hours, and now they were being offered additional videos to watch.Whitt?s group decided on a series of digital clips called ?Meet the Moment.? Each video is five or six minutes long and focused on a specific topic like sleep, breathing, parenting and avoiding anxiety. Whitt said she worked with experts and performance coaches from professional football, basketball and baseball leagues as well as collegiate and Olympic athletes to create the resilience training and skills development content.?Video content around breathing and sleep are the most meaningful ways we can rest and recover as well as momentary detachment throughout the work day,? Whitt said. She added that another popular video was about ?meeting times of uncertainty with authenticity and humility.?The main characters in the resilience training videos are people who have experienced high-stress situations like a big game, combat or other pressures.?Resilience is a skill that can be built, practiced and cultivated,? Google says in its digital resilience instructions for employees.In less than a month, 30,000 Google employees have watched the videos. Whitt said the company has also hosted 150 virtual events globally to raise awareness about mental health and ?prioritizing wellbeing.? Contractors and temporary workers, who make up roughly half of Google?s overall workforce, can access some but not all of the Covid-19 mental health and well-being resources, the company said.To produce the videos in a way that was compliant with Covid-19 precautions, Whitt said Google used robotic cameras developed by a third party. The filming took place in Google?s offices in Atlanta and Boulder, Colorado, while the directors and the audio visual team connected virtually.As a part of the employee training, the company also expanded some existing activities it created just before the pandemic called ?TEA check-ins,? an acronym for thoughts, energy and attention. They?re meant to address common symptoms of burnout, and managers are encouraged to say, ?Let?s have some TEA,? as a way to get employees to be proactive.?It gave people an opportunity to check in with, ?Where are you in this moment??? Whitt said. ?Are you distracted? Do you need a nap? Push-ups??Google developed a variation aimed at addressing mental health needs among employees who were parents and caregivers. Video content includes tutorials on how to focus on things like time management and household chores when people are distracted.Parents have the added challenge of ?the transition to having kids at home with a day job while navigating what it?s like to be physically distanced from people you care about,? Whitt said. The company also offered tips on ?how to build a productive workspace in the kitchen.?To try and keep things light and fun where possible, the company began offering virtual classes on dancing, cooking and a virtual ?yoga with your dog? event. The videos feature many of the same instructors and counselors who taught onsite at Google?s offices. Employees have also formed virtual orchestras and comedy shows.?We wanted to continue to connect employees with activities, arts and music ? all that were part of our culture when they were in the office,?

Nov-20,"PARIS (Reuters) - Shoppers searching Google for cosmetics will be able to try them on virtually through a deal with L?Oreal, as the French group looks to make up for lost store sales caused by coronavirus lockdowns by expanding online.Slideshow ( 3 images )Maybelline maker L'Oreal OREP.PA, which returned to comparable sales growth in the third quarter when coronavirus restrictions eased, has sped up some of its web initiatives as a result of the pandemic, its digital chief Lubomira Rochet said.?There?s been an acceleration in all our partnerships due to COVID-19,? Rochet said in an online presentation on Thursday.The Google GOOGL.O partnership relies on technology designed by ModiFace, a Canadian augmented reality specialist acquired by L'Oreal in 2018, and will also extend to the U.S. group's YouTube video sharing platform, Rochet said.People seeking lipsticks or eye shadows by L?Oreal brands, which include Lancome and Urban Decay, who come across their adverts on Google or YouTube can then try them online.YouTube is one of the go-to sites for cosmetics users who often seek out make-up tutorials online, or want to learn from others how to curl their hair.L'Oreal, which already had a ModiFace partnership with social media site Facebook FB.O, has seen usage of virtual make-up tools rise fivefold during COVID-19 lockdowns this year, and the conversion rate from an advert to a purchase was three times higher with the try-ons, Rochet said.Consumers used it to mimic hair dye colours in particular during coronavirus shutdowns, Rochet added.Many countries in Europe including France and Belgium have now re-entered lockdown, forcing beauty chains and hair salons to close, and hitting travel retail sales.Online sales of beauty products, especially in China, have made-up for part of the losses and Rochet expects half L?Oreal?s sales are likely to come from the web within the next three to seven years, up from around a quarter now.",0.050641026,"oreal 0.0275, rochet 0.0273, sales 0.0231, online 0.0231, make 0.0188, google 0.0145, youtube 0.0145, hair 0.0144, coronavirus 0.0144"
Nov-20,"When Google says some of its controversial tracking features are ""opt in"" only, do you realize you've actually agreed to let them snoop on you? Take, for instance, Google's new Pay app.The company is encouraging people to try it out and let Google monitor their finances and purchases in exchange for personalized offers, on a three-month trial. For instance, if Google knows you eat at Burger King, it says it could hit you up with specific BK offers, as opposed to generic restaurant deals in your neighborhood. But it knows people are wary about giving Google yet another license to track their every movement, as it already does with Maps, YouTube viewing, searches and the like. It already knows where you go, what you watch, who you spend time with, what stores you drive to ? and more. How do you feel about Google tracking your purchases from inside your wallet?So in announcing the new program, in very small print as part of the user agreement process, Google noted that this Pay personalization feature was opt-in: ""At the end of three months, you can decide if you want to keep it on or off."" Google Pay's personalization  GOOGLEThat sounds great, right? Google is putting the decision in your hands. But reality check, folks: Most people won?t even know what they signed up for. The lettering is tiny, just another window of user agreements that people zip through.?People won?t know what they?ve just signed up for,? says Patrick Jackson, the chief technology officer of the privacy app Disconnect. The ?Turn on? page is just one of many pages consumers will see when they download the Pay app, and quickly, as they always do, say yes to all the terms. First, Google asks whether it can distribute your phone number as the Pay app, introduced Wednesday, has been rejiggered as part Venmo, part Quicken, part Apple Pay, a vehicle to tap and pay at retail, split pizzas with friends and monitor your finances. So Google needs identification to share with friends. OK, I got that. Next: ?Earn rewards when you pay.? Discounts and prizes always welcome.Then, the big one: ?Turn on Personalization within Google Pay.? This is in big type. Underneath, in small letters, you see there are ?the most relevant offers? from stores and ?get recommendations for ways to save.?Here?s the opt-in: ?If you turn on Personalization within Google Pay, this data and additional info (like the location where you made a purchase) will also be saved and used to personalize your Google Pay experience. You can also try this setting only for three months.?Consumers are then told they can go to their Google account to turn it back and stop the ads, once they?ve accepted.Jackson says the ?opt in? is a ruse, because Google knows that most people just say yes when they sign up for anything: ?The only people who read this stuff are the lawyers.?That it?s presented as a ?trial? shows Jackson how important this data is to Google. This takes it beyond receipts that Google finds in your Gmail, like airline flights and hotel reservations.""Now they can track other purchases, too,"" Jackson says. ""People probably don?t understand the trade-offs.?And those are that, via the new Google Pay app, Google gets access to your checkbook, debit card, purchases, friends you go out with for meals and their contact information, as well as stores you frequent. (Google says it won't sell your data to third-party marketers, which is what Venmo, the ""social payment"" app, does do.) But imagine your Quicken transaction history now in Google?s hands. Are you comfortable with that? Do you want even more personalized ads hitting you up based on where you frequent? Food for thought.In a statement, Google said it has ensured that it gives users all the information they need  to make an informed decision: ""After which, the user can still choose to keep this turned off.

Nov-20,"Google is loosening control over the core of its Chrome browser, a move that helps Microsoft , Samsung and Brave build competitors while advancing the search giant's vision of the web.Over the past six months, Google welcomed a new outside developer into the leadership of its Chromium project, the software that powers the similarly named browser. The Alphabet subsidiary is also granting outsiders access to its previously proprietary software development system and allows outside features even when Google doesn't incorporate them into the flagship Chrome browser.Chromium is open-source software, which means anyone can modify and use it. Even with open-source projects, however, outsiders can have trouble convincing organizers to accept their changes and additions, making it harder to contribute and benefit.Google took pains to draw attention to the changes at the BlinkOn conference earlier this week. ""It's really cool to see so many people and groups with different priorities coming together and finding solutions that not only meet their individual agendas but also advance the common goal of improving the web,"" said Danyao Wang, a Chrome engineer at Google.Opening up to outside influence fits into Google's broader strategy for the web. The allied-yet-competing Chromium-based browsers spread Google's web technology, a software foundation for richly interactive web apps as opposed to static web pages and simple forms. Google sees that ability as critical to the future of the web, a vision that stands in stark contrast to Apple's view. The iPhone maker doesn't want web apps to inherit the same capabilities as mobile and desktop apps, a power expansion that threatens its rich iOS ecosystem. Apple and one of its allies, Mozilla , worry that letting web apps communicate with USB and Bluetooth devices or access PC file systems opens up too many security risks. Google and its allies say web apps are inherently safer than native apps thanks to protective browser sandboxing technology and security forged in an unforgiving environment devoid of app store reviewers checking for malware. Limiting advanced interactivity to native apps will cripple the web's long-term health, they say.Google, which already accounts for 66% of web usage via Chrome, according to analytics firm StatCounter, has attracted powerful allies. Microsoft, Samsung and Brave are the most prominent companies building Chromium-based browsers. Others include Vivaldi , Opera, Yandex and UC Browser. Microsoft now ships Edge to millions of Windows PCs, Samsung is the top Android phone maker and 20 million people use Brave each month.Apple didn't respond to a request for comment.Mozilla, whose Firefox browser rose to prominence by challenging Microsoft's once-dominant Internet Explorer, doesn't like it when one browser gets very powerful. ""Firefox is one of the last independent browsers standing, making it more relevant and important now more than ever to an open web,"" the nonprofit said in a statement. ""We are firm believers that it's unhealthy when one implementation becomes the de facto standard and that a diversity of browser engines is important to ensuring that standards are of high quality.""Google opens up ChromiumExpanding governance is the most significant change to the Chromium project. Before the change, Google engineers largely decided whether Chromium would accept or reject major new features. A new nomination process that began earlier this year allows outsiders into the inner circle. Manuel Rego Casanovas of open-source developer firm Igalia joined in March through the process.""We're looking forward to more representation in the coming year,"" Alex Russell, who heads Chrome's web standards work, said in a statement.Chromium project leaders are also accepting features from other companies into Chromium even if they won't be added to Chrome. One example is the StorageAccess interface, a privacy-related project Apple's Safari browser team launched to govern how websites store and access some types of data, said Yoav Weiss, who also spoke at BlinkOn. Allowing non-Chrome features is a deliberate decision to give other developers the ability to design Chromium-based browsers that can achieve their priorities, Google said.Chromium allies don't have to ship all the web features Google likes. Indeed, Brave strips out some features like WebUSB. However, most of the Chromium code base makes it into the non-Chrome browsers, furthering Google's vision.Brave Chief Executive Brendan Eich wants Google to go farther in sharing control. ""The Chromium playing field and rules still tilt steeply in Google's favor,"" Eich said. Brave disables Chromium features it views as nonstandard and privacy risks, but Google doesn't accept those changes in Chromium, he said.Helping developers build ChromiumGoogle also now lets outsiders use its formerly internal software to build system called Goma that can tap the power of Google's data centers to build Chromium. Ordinarily that can take hours, slowing the pace of iteration for developers eager to experiment with new features. Goma will enable more people to contribute to Chromium, Google said.The search giant is also inviting outside developers to its internal educational events. Earlier this month, Google replaced its internal Chrome University events, which explain how the browser works, with the first Chromium University. Sixty organizations participated.he company could go farther and contribute Chromium to a neutral foundation, an approach Google and other companies have taken with earlier open-source projects. The Linux Foundation is responsible  for the core of the Linux operating system. Google contributed its Kubernetes data center software to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation in 2015. LLVM, an important software building tool that blossomed under Apple's oversight, is now run by the LLVM Foundation.Google isn't planning a Chromium Foundation, and outside contributors aren't asking for one, the company said.Microsoft didn't comment on whether it would like to see a neutral foundation, but did say it's working closely with Chromium team members, ""bring the best of Chromium together with the best of Microsoft Edge .""Non-Google Chromium participation increasesThe changes are having an effect. Among the hundreds of Chromium contributors, 90 new ones came from Google over the last year but even more came from outside, Weiss said. Microsoft, which converted its Edge browser into a Chromium project over the last two years, is the top outside contributor, accounting for 35 percent of non-Google contributors in 2020. Intel , Igalia, Yandex, Opera, Samsung, LG Electronics and Arm also contribute substantially.In terms of changes to the code base, Igalia leads the non-Google crowd. Microsoft is ""closing that gap quickly,"" Weiss said. Since November of last year, 161 Microsoft developers made 1,835 changes to Chromium, improving things like battery life, web accessibility for people with issues like vision impairment, WebXR virtual reality and augmented reality abilities, and modernized styling for web controls and forms. Since Microsoft first joined Chromium in December 2018, it's made 4,443 changes.""Other companies are increasing their investment in Chromium and the web platform, and that is awesome,"" Weiss said.Correction, Nov. 20: Chromium has had two other non-Google engineer overseers earlier, but Manuel Rego Casanovas is the first to arrive through a new nomination process.",0.170392775,"google 0.0362, chromium 0.0335, browser 0.0135, microsoft 0.0123, chrome 0.0114, change 0.0110, open 0.0099, feature 0.0098, software 0.0089"
Nov-20,"Late last month the Department of Justice filed a long-anticipated antitrust lawsuit against Google, accusing the company of engaging in anti-competitive practices. It?s the most aggressive challenge the DOJ has made against a tech giant since it accused Microsoft of anti-competitive practices in 1997. The lawsuit homes in on Google?s search dominance in the United States (Google represents 80 percent, according to the complaint) and the practices and deals that have solidified that claim. The case is sure to take years, but the ramifications for Silicon Valley ? and the country in general ? may be huge. Intelligencer spoke with Scott Galloway, marketing professor at NYU Stern School of Business and co-host of Vox Media?s Pivot podcast, about the complaint, the potential remedies, and the odds that a tech executive will end up in handcuffs sometime after Election Day.What is your initial read of the DOJ?s complaint?Antitrust action is overdue and late. But at the same time, the fear around this is that it may have been hurried as an opportunity for the administration to score points before the election, which may have diminished the voracity of the suit ? as evidenced by the fact that a number of DOJ lawyers stepped back from the case this summer, saying they weren?t ready.You can bet that Google has been preparing for war for years. There are 40 lawyers at the DOJ working on the Google antitrust case. I bet Google has 400 lawyers working on this across its various law firms, probably 50 to 100 PR executives, and probably 50 lobbyists whispering in every elected official?s ear. If you believe that antitrust is important for business and society, this is troubling.You?re worried that Google is now more powerful than the United States Department of Justice. If the DOJ can?t stop Google, who can? Well, that?s the frightening thing. There was no whisper of that fear 30 years ago when the DOJ went after Michael Milken. At that point, he was one of the wealthiest people in the country, but there was a general assumption that he was fucked, that the army of lawyers from the DOJ could overrun him. Likewise, when the DOJ sued Microsoft 30 years ago, nobody voiced concern that the DOJ wasn?t ready to take on the company, which was arguably the master of the universe and the Google of its era.When you think about it over the last 30 years, tax rates on corporations and the wealthy have plummeted. Corporate profits have exploded, and it reflects an imbalance. The result may be that the DOJ is outgunned. That?s the fear. And it reflects a broader sickness in our society that when the sheriff is scared of the outlaws, the town is going to be dysfunctional. Having said that, the thing that gives me a little bit of comfort is the narrowness of the DOJ?s complaint.Is that because the DOJ is being shrewd?History doesn?t repeat itself, but it echoes. This is an echo of the DOJ case against Microsoft. And the DOJ, which was initially successful against Microsoft, said that Microsoft was using bundling power and economic might to force every computer hardware manufacturer to bundle Internet Explorer. The DOJ is taking a page out of that notebook and saying, ?Google has been bundling its search with the biggest distribution points, whether it?s Apple or Mozilla.?I think they?re smart to start narrow because the DOJ and/or the state attorneys general themselves can then broaden it. A lot of people would argue that Google?s monopoly abuse in the ad market is greater, and I think there was disappointment that the DOJ didn?t go for one big coordinated strategy across the whole of Google or that it wasn?t one big antitrust case against all of Big Tech, going gangster on Google, Facebook, and Amazon. The overlap of efficiencies and arguments might?ve made for a bigger, more impactful case that would have to play out faster across more monopolies.But I actually feel pretty good about this because they?re starting narrower, which means they can?t screw up too badly and it can be expanded. And I think you?re going to see a hypothetical Biden administration ? assuming the polls are right ? run with this.It seems as if the DOJ complaint is on behalf of competitors and not necessarily the consumer. Why? Consumer sentiment is always kind of the backdrop. The DOJ has to go after Google based on existing laws. What Congress might do ? and the DOJ didn?t want to wait ? is write new laws that are more about market power than where antitrust has been since Robert Bork [the judge and legal scholar considered to be the godfather of antitrust law in the U.S.in the late ?70s and ?80s. Right now the thinking is that it?s a consumer harm test, and the primary metric for consumer harm is prices. Because the majority of products Google and Facebook make are free to the consumer, that makes it difficult to press the case on behalf of consumers. I think under the current antitrust laws, they were probably smart to represent anti-competitive practices ? Google is harming other companies.What can we learn from the E.U.s stabs at these sorts of cases? Is there any sort of road map? We can learn from the E.U. I would argue that a lot of the regulation there that was meant to be an opposing force or a weapon to turn back to Big Tech has ended up being a weapon to further defend and entrench Big Tech. The additional privacy regulations that Big Tech now has to comply with, like GDPR, is a nuisance, but it?s a nuisance they can much better afford than small and medium-size companies. It?s not like Big Tech is making less money or being less aggressive in Europe. I think we learned from that model. It?s important, but I?m not sure we take from it a playbook around specific regulation. It might be my bias just because I think you have to break them up.How realistic is it that this case leads to the government breaking Google up? My thesis all along is that the government will never have the opportunity to actually legally break these guys up, because Big Tech?s lawyers will have a meeting well before that decision is announced to decide on their own to prophylactically break themselves up. These companies are worth more separate. Bezos can say, ?Well, what if I spin Amazon?s cloud service?? If they agree, he still controls both firms. He is still the largest shareholder and he gets richer. I?ve always maintained that if Google had to spin Google Cloud and YouTube, the shareholders benefit. The sum of the parts may be greater than the whole.What about regulation, what is at stake for Big Tech in this election? I don?t think there?s any getting around the fact that if the administration changes, there?s going to be more thoughtful regulation. I think tech probably benefits in the short run if Trump is reelected, but probably is worse off in the long run because healthy, consistent trade policy and technology policy are good for these guys. If Trump is reelected there are probably bigger winners and bigger losers based on what Trump decides to do that day, whether it?s trying to block the acquisition of Time Warner by AT&T or his disdain for Jeff Bezos, there?ll be more of what I call ?border skirmishes? with specific companies.You have used climate change as an analogy for Big Tech?s expansion. What apocalyptic meltdown are we marching toward? The apocalypse is that we have become overrun by private power; that?s what I was talking about with the DOJ and Google. When private corporations start meddling, government is no longer a countervailing force. In fact, it becomes a co-conspirator. I think we?re very close to that tipping point. When Amazon has more full-time lobbyists living in Washington, D.C., than there are sitting U.S. senators, when the Facebook communications department is beginning to rival the number of journalists in the newsroom at the New York Times, the question is: Have we become overrun?The algebra of deterrence has failed. When Aunt Becky got caught bribing coaches to let her daughters into universities, she had to do a perp walk and went to jail. You bet that the next time a wealthy Hollywood actress gets a call from a friend saying, ?For a quarter of a million dollars I can get Susie into USC,? they will say, ?No, thank you.? So it works. People have a very healthy fear of prison. But the algebra of deterrence has totally failed around Big Tech. When you fine Facebook $5 billion ?  less than one percent of its market capitalization ? for potentially perverting our democracy, for decreasing the respect and the validity of our elections, you don?t have an algebra of deterrence. You have an algebra of enablement. You are encouraging people to break the law because the downside, if you get caught, is one percent of the market capitalization. The government is not deterring Big Tech from breaking the law, it?s sort of encouraging it. If you want to clean up a lot of problems in Big Tech, you can do it with one image: a Big Tech executive doing a perp walk",0.100088166,"google 0.0248, tech 0.0187, think 0.0138, case 0.0114, antitrust 0.0102, company 0.0078, probably 0.0078, break 0.0078, go 0.0077, lawyers 0.0066"
Nov-20,"n October, the US Department of Justice launched a federal antitrust lawsuit against Google, accusing the technology giant of abusing its dominance in the market for internet search. To explore how Google achieved that dominant position, what impact that position has on society, and what?if any?steps policy makers should take to address the dominance of tech companies, Chicago Booth?s Initiative on Global Markets invited both its US and European Economic Experts Panels to express their views on these issues.Statement A: Google?s dominance of the market for internet search arose mainly from a combination of economies of scale and a quality algorithm.Responses weighted by each panelist?s confidenceA strong majority of each panel agreed that Google?s dominance of the market for internet search arose mainly from a combination of economies of scale and a quality algorithm.Nicholas Bloom of Stanford said, ?Google?s search engine has been far better from the outset?this alone can explain why it dominated. It is simply a better search engine.?Franklin Allen of Imperial College London added, ?They do have a good algorithm and this is a big part of their success, but increasing returns to scale due to network effects are large.? And Daron Acemoglu of MIT noted: ?Quality of algorithm likely played a role early on, but now it?s mostly network effects?dominance breeds dominance.?Robert Hall of Stanford introduced an additional factor behind Google?s dominance: ?Not to mention good timing.? David Autor of MIT commented: ?If Google hadn?t invented page rank, someone else would have. Google benefited from getting there first with a good idea.?Pete Klenow of Stanford drew attention to background information on Google?s cluster architecture. And John Van Reenen of MIT pointed to ?General findings in literature including our work on superstar firms.?Statement B: In light of Google?s dominance, its current operating practices could have a substantial negative effect on social welfare in the long run.Responses weighted by each panelist?s confidenceOn the question of whether Google?s dominance and current operating practices could have a substantial negative effect on social welfare in the long run, more experts agreed than disagreed, but there was substantial uncertainty.Among those who agreed with the statement, some referred to how potential negative effects might arise. Barry Eichengreen of the University of California at Berkeley said, ?Overwhelming market dominance creating formidable barriers to entry are not good.? Bengt Holmstrom of MIT explained: ?Difficult to assess. De facto monopoly due to superior algorithm. Worried about limited contestability and biased ad rankings.? Franklin Allen added, ?As with many monopolies, they will have the wrong incentives with regard to pricing of advertising and to innovation.?Others develop the theme of the possible impact of market dominance on a firm?s conduct. Christopher Pissarides of London School of Economics noted simply: ?Power corrupts.? Larry Samuelson of Yale said, ?Innovation brought Google to a dominant position, but Google bars no holds in preserving that position, with adverse consequences.?Daron Acemoglu went further: ?It walks, swims, and quacks like a duck, it?s probably a duck. It looks, behaves, and dominates like a monopoly, it?ll probably harm welfare.? And David Autor warned, ?I fear Google is becoming the new *old* Microsoft, before the antitrust case. They may not be doing substantial harm now?but they could.? Pete Klenow linked to a 2010 study asking exactly that question: Is Google the next Microsoft?A number of panelists picked up on the word ?could.? Pinelopi Goldberg of Yale stated, ?They COULD; this does not mean they WILL. Regulators should be vigilant and scrutinize practices going forward.? Robert Shimer of the University of Chicago added, ?The key word in the question is ?could.? It could also have a substantial positive effect, as it has in the past.?Anil Kashyap of Chicago Booth pointed to a mechanism by which negative effects could happen: a ?kill zone? in the space of startups, as described by venture capitalists, where the prospect of acquisition by an incumbent platform undermines early adoption and makes new entrants not worth funding. Kjetil Storesletten of the University of Oslo worried about the effects on other industries: ?Indirect costs: dominant tech giants soak up the advertisement revenue the free press/media depends on. This risks crowding out the press.?Karl Whelan of University College Dublin expressed, ?Weak agreement, but we?ve seen large tech companies rise and fall. This could be the ?peak Google? era and something else replaces it.? But Peter Neary of Oxford, who strongly agreed with the statement, responded: ?A classic case of natural monopoly. Unfortunately, it is (almost) at the global level so countervailing action would have to be global too.?Among the sizeable minority of panelists who said that they were uncertain, some find the question insufficiently specific. Jonathan Levin of Stanford replied: ?Struggling with question framing. Some practices deserve scrutiny. On net, however, its products and services create enormous value.?Kenneth Judd of Stanford said, ?Fuzzy answer to a fuzzy question. ?Could? have negative impact, yes. But current operations include creation and sharing of powerful tools.? Pol Antras of Harvard added, ?Ambiguous language here. Google will not have decreased steady-state welfare; but relative to a counterfactual with more competition, it may.?Others were unsure that they knew enough for anything more than a response of ?uncertain.? Christian Leuz of Chicago Booth noted: ?Given Google?s dominance in the market for search, there clearly is potential for such harm. Don?t know enough about its practices to answer.? Darrell Duffie of Stanford commented: ?Depends on how Google exercises its market power, and on the quality of potentially superior entrants. Those are beyond my expertise.?Patrick Honohan of Trinity College Dublin, who voted ?no opinion,? responded: ?Future dynamics of the sector too uncertain for me to assess.? And Richard Schmalensee of MIT said, ?I don?t know enough about its current operating practices to be very confident.?Among those who disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement, Robert Hall stated, ?I take it that would mean that regulators are currently passing up a constructive intervention, which is not the case.? And Nicholas Bloom concluded: ?Search is a natural monopoly. If better searches exist they will win?Google beat out Alta Vista on product quality.?Statement C: The nature of the market dominance of technology giants in the digital economy warrants either the imposition of some kind of regulation or a fundamental change in antitrust policy.Responses weighted by each panelist?s confidenceEuropean IGM Panel?s responsesBar chart with 5 bars.View as data table, European IGM Panel?s responsesThe chart has 1 X axis displaying categories.The chart has 1 Y axis displaying values.

A considerably larger proportion of experts on the European panel agreed or strongly agreed with the statement than on the US panel, and just over a fifth of US experts disagreed.Christopher Pissarides, who strongly agreed with the statement, said, ?They are becoming monopolies in very sensitive areas. Human nature cannot be trusted in such circumstances.? Bengt Holmstrom, who agreed, responded: ?Market values strongly suggest a need for review. Especially now that competition from China [has been] curtailed.? And Barry Eichengreen, who also agreed, concluded: ?Absent public sector intervention, this problem won?t solve itself.?Others who agreed with the statement go into a little more detail on what should be done. Larry Samuelson said, ?The tech industry is rife with natural monopolies, which are routinely regulated in other sectors.? Franklin Allen commented: ?We do need new antitrust policies and new regulation as well as new taxation to deal with the issues raised by the tech firms.? Daron Acemoglu added, ?This should probably involve more than light-touch regulation. We should also deal with the effects of Big Tech on direction of innovation.? And Jonathan Levin noted: ?To take one example?thoughtful, informed regulation is needed in areas like privacy and data rights.?Austan Goolsbee of Chicago Booth goes back to history for perspective: ?Go look at what happened the last time there was a massive disruption to technology and increase in corporate power, 1880-1930.? David Autor added, ?The Sherman Act was not set up for the networked world. Case in point: Facebook should never have been allowed to buy WhatsApp.?Columbia?s Jose Scheinkman concurred: ?Need to increase scrutiny of acquisitions of related businesses, for example, WhatsApp by Facebook.? Booth?s Richard Thaler, who said he was uncertain, also reflected on policy on mergers and acquisitions: ?It is hard to favor unspecified changes in the rules. I don?t think Google should be able to buy Waze, nor Facebook buy Instagram.?Among others who said they were uncertain, Darrell Duffie of Stanford asked: ?Are existing antitrust laws enough? DOJ seems to think so, and they seemed to work for Bell and Microsoft. For Google: stay tuned.? Richard Schmalensee warned, ?Those sorts of changes surely deserve serious consideration, but I?m not confident that we can find changes that are net beneficial.?Among those who disagreed, several comment on the adequacy of existing antitrust laws. Judith Chevalier of Yale said, ?Enforcement of merger policy, for example, would ideally be stronger, but I don?t think that derives from a fundamental deficiency in the laws.? Similarly, Michael Greenstone of the University of Chicago remarked: ?There are always legitimate questions about enforcement but I think the laws are up to the task.?Kenneth Judd of Stanford added, ?A key point in the current discussion is the Apple-Google arrangement. I guess that current law can handle this; no need for new rules.? And Robert Hall, who said he was uncertain, noted: ?Merger regulation is in place and a good idea. Regulators should understand that there is not competition in the market, but for the market.?Others who disagreed doubt that there are grounds as yet for changes in regulation or antitrust policy. Robert Shimer said, ?We are yet to see evidence of significant damage caused by these firms, but do see substantial social benefits.? Pinelopi Goldberg added, ?It is not clear what problem the regulator is asked to solve. Being worried about future abuse of power is no justification for regulation.?Nicholas Bloom, who strongly disagreed with the statement, is concerned about the dangers: ?The history of government regulation is poor, and particularly with governments like Trump in the US, I do not want them to have more control.? And Anil Kashyap, who voted ?no opinion,? asked: ?How do we know what kind of changes would result?and probably they would not just be designed based on economic principles.?Finally, Pete Klenow referred to further reading on the economics of data property rights. And Karl Whelan recalled a book coauthored more than 20 years ago by Google?s chief economist, offering ?a strategic guide to the network economy?: ?I learned lots from reading Varian-Shapiro?s Information Rules.

Dec-20,"A group of 10 Republican-led US states has opened a new front in US antitrust actions against Google, charging the internet group with abusing its monopoly over parts of the online advertising market and colluding with Facebook to shut out rival ad exchanges.The allegation that Google worked with Facebook to carve up advertising profits adds a new twist to the multiplying lawsuits that claim the world?s biggest tech companies have acted together to buttress their power. The case comes two months after the Department of Justice, backed by 11 states, accused Google of using a web of contracts and partnerships with other companies to block distribution of rival search engines.That case included a claim that Google had deliberately forged a deal with Apple, worth as much as $12bn a year, to reinforce its monopoly, though there was no claim that Apple had colluded in the plan.Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney-general who is leading the group of Republicans targeting Google, disclosed the latest action on Wednesday.Google has ?repeatedly used its monopolistic power to control pricing, [and] engage in collusions to rig auctions [of online ads] in a tremendous violation of justice?, he said.Referring to Big Tech companies, he added: ?It?s time for them to learn the hard way that you do not mess with Texas.?Please use the sharing tools found via the share button at the top or side of articles.

The Republican-led complaint against Google, filed in federal court in the Eastern District of Texas, takes aim in particular at its advertising exchange, which handles the automated bidding and placement for a large volume of advertising around the web. Dina Srinivasan, a researcher at Yale who was involved in drafting the complaint, said that Google?s involvement selling technology to both buyers and sellers of advertising, as well as running an ad exchange, echoed the kind of conflicts of interest that had occurred in the past in financial markets. Experience with financial regulation ?shows that the number one thing you must do is minimise conflicts in the market?, she said, meaning that a structural separation was needed to limit the number of roles Google plays in online advertising. The lawsuit said that Google had 90 per cent of the market for tools US publishers use to sell online ads. It uses that power ? and its role selling technology to advertisers ? to channel transactions through its in-house exchange, the lawsuit alleged, meaning the company effectively engages in ?insider trading?. ?In this electronically traded market, Google is pitcher, batter, and umpire, all at the same time,? according to the states. Facebook had at one stage backed an alternative technology that would have weakened Google?s ability to channel transactions through its own exchange, making the social network a potential rival, the lawsuit claimed. But it said that Facebook had dropped the idea after Google offered ?special auction access?, giving Facebook preferential entry to transactions handled through the Google exchange. The two companies also ?agreed to manipulate publisher auctions in Facebook?s favour?, the states claimed. Facebook is not a defendant in the lawsuit, and declined to comment on the allegations in it. Google called the lawsuit ?meritless?, saying in a statement: ?Digital ad prices have fallen over the last decade. Ad tech fees are falling too. Google?s ad tech fees are lower than the industry average. These are the hallmarks of a highly competitive industry.?

A bipartisan group of attorneys-general, led by Phil Weiser of Colorado, was set to file a separate suit targeting Google?s dominance in the search market on Thursday, according to one person with knowledge of the case. Mr Paxton had come under pressure to relinquish his role in the Google investigation. Eight of his aides resigned or were fired this year after accusing him of using his position to interfere with an investigation into a campaign donor. The officials included Darren McCarty, a former Texas deputy attorney-general and the top lawyer on the Google case. Following those revelations, Democratic attorneys-general called on Mr Paxton to resign, warning that the accusations risked imperilling their ?joint work?. One person close to the process said that there had been no disagreements over the substance of the online advertising charges, and that the Texas-led group had sought to grab the limelight ahead of the results of a similar DoJ investigation. Facebook has separately been charged with violating antitrust laws by 48 attorneys-general from both parties in a lawsuit launched last week. The suit accused the social media company of a ?years-long course of anti-competitive conduct?, including strategically buying up rivals that threatened its monopoly and cutting off services to squeeze rival developers.",0.093848949,"google 0.0329, facebook 0.0142, article 0.0141, share 0.0140, lawsuit 0.0124, advertise 0.0123, company 0.0108, use 0.0107, market 0.0107"
Dec-20,"More than 30 states added to Google?s mushrooming legal woes on Thursday, accusing the Silicon Valley titan of illegally arranging its search results to push out smaller rivals.One day after 10 other states accused Google of abusing its dominance in advertising and overcharging publishers, and two months after the Justice Department said the company?s deals with other tech giants throttled competition, the bipartisan group of state prosecutors said in a lawsuit on Thursday that Google downplayed websites that let users search for information in specialized areas like home repair services and travel reviews. The prosecutors also accused the company of using exclusive deals with phone makers like Apple to prioritize Google?s search service over rivals like Bing and DuckDuckGo.That suppression, the states said in their lawsuit, has locked in Google?s nearly 90 percent market dominance in search and has made it impossible for the smaller companies to grow into formidable competitors. Google has sought to extend that dominance to new venues like home voice assistants, said the prosecutors, from states including Colorado, Nebraska, New York and Utah.The cascade of lawsuits against Google, which the company says it will fight in court, are indicative of the growing backlash against the largest tech companies, a movement that increasingly looks like it will usher in major changes for some of the world?s most popular digital services.Critics have argued for years that Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon built sprawling empires over commerce, communications and culture, and then abused their growing power. But only recently have federal or state regulators brought major cases against them.The Federal Trade Commission and 40 state attorneys general last week accused Facebook of buying smaller rivals like Instagram and WhatsApp to maintain its dominance, in a case that threatens to break the company apart.

Dec-20," Facebook Inc and Alphabet?s Google, the two biggest players in online advertising, used a series of deals to consolidate their market power illegally, Texas and nine other states alleged in a lawsuit against Google on Wednesday. Google and Facebook compete heavily in internet ad sales, together capturing over half of the market globally. The two players agreed in a publicized deal in 2018 to start giving Facebook?s advertiser clients the option to place ads within Google?s network of publishing partners, the complaint alleged. Executives at the highest level of the companies signed off on the deal, according to the complaint.For example, a sneaker blog that uses software from Google to sell ads could end up generating revenue from a footwear retailer that bought ads on Facebook.Google reached similar partnerships with other advertising companies as part of an effort to maintain market share that was internally codenamed Project Jedi, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said.But what Google did not announce publicly is that it gave Facebook preferential treatment, the complaint alleged. Facebook agreed to back down from supporting competing software, which publishers had developed to dent Google?s market power, the complaint said.?Facebook decided to dangle the threat of competition in Google?s face and then cut a deal to manipulate the auction,? it said, citing internal communications.In exchange, the states said, Facebook received various benefits, including access to Google data and policy exceptions that enabled its clients to unfairly get more ads placed than clients of other Google partners could.Google spokesman Peter Schottenfels described the states? accusations about the ongoing partnership as inaccurate and said that Facebook does not receive special data. Facebook did not respond to requests for comment.The complaint also alleged that Google and Facebook engaged in fixing prices of ads and have continued to cooperate, though the section was heavily redacted and left it unclear just how and when the companies allegedly used their ?market allocation agreement.?However, it said that ?given the scope and extensive nature of cooperation between the two companies, Google and Facebook were highly aware that their agreement could trigger antitrust violations. The two companies discussed, negotiated, and memorialized how they would cooperate with one another.?The states did not accuse Facebook of wrongdoing in the complaint.The U.S. Department of Justice also has been investigating the agreement between the companies as part of its antitrust probe into Google, six people familiar with the investigation said. But the Justice Department, which sued Google over separate conduct in October, has yet to bring any allegations related to the 2018 deal.A Justice Department spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.",-0.053287982,"google 0.0528, facebook 0.0432, company 0.0208, complaint 0.0207, deal 0.0175, market 0.0175, state 0.0142, allege 0.0141, give 0.0110"
Dec-20,"A well-respected Google researcher said she was fired by the company after criticizing its approach to minority hiring and the biases built into today?s artificial intelligence systems.Timnit Gebru, who was a co-leader of Google?s Ethical A.I. team, said in a tweet on Wednesday evening that she was fired because of an email she had sent a day earlier to a group that included company employees.In the email, reviewed by The New York Times, she expressed exasperation over Google?s response to efforts by her and other employees to increase minority hiring and draw attention to bias in artificial intelligence.?Your life starts getting worse when you start advocating for underrepresented people. You start making the other leaders upset,? the email read. ?There is no way more documents or more conversations will achieve anything.?Her departure from Google highlights growing tension between Google?s outspoken work force and its buttoned-up senior management, while raising concerns over the company?s efforts to build fair and reliable technology. It may also have a chilling effect on both Black tech workers and researchers who have left academia in recent years for high-paying jobs in Silicon Valley.?Her firing only indicates that scientists, activists and scholars who want to work in this field ? and are Black women ? are not welcome in Silicon Valley,? said Mutale Nkonde, a fellow with the Stanford Digital Civil Society Lab. ?It is very disappointing.?A Google spokesman declined to comment. In an email sent to Google employees, Jeff Dean, who oversees Google?s A.I. work, including that of Dr. Gebru and her team, called her departure ?a difficult moment, especially given the important research topics she was involved in, and how deeply we care about responsible A.I. research as an org and as a company.?After years of an anything-goes environment where employees engaged in freewheeling discussions in companywide meetings and online message boards, Google has started to crack down on workplace discourse. Many Google employees have bristled at the new restrictions and have argued that the company has broken from a tradition of transparency and free debate.On Wednesday, the National Labor Relations Board said Google had most likely violated labor law when it fired two employees who were involved in labor organizing. The federal agency said Google illegally surveilled the employees before firing them.Google?s battles with its workers, who have spoken out in recent years about the company?s handling of sexual harassment and its work with the Defense Department and federal border agencies, have diminished its reputation as a utopia for tech workers with generous salaries, perks and workplace freedom.Like other technology companies, Google has also faced criticism for not doing enough to resolve the lack of women and racial minorities among its ranks.The problems of racial inequality, especially the mistreatment of Black employees at technology companies, has plagued Silicon Valley for years. Coinbase, the most valuable cryptocurrency start-up, has experienced an exodus of Black employees in the last two years over what the workers said was racist and discriminatory treatment.Researchers worry that the people who are building artificial intelligence systems may be building their own biases into the technology. Over the past several years, several public experiments have shown that the systems often interact differently with people of color ? perhaps because they are underrepresented among the developers who create those systems.Dr. Gebru, 37, was born and raised in Ethiopia. In 2018, while a researcher at Stanford University, she helped write a paper that is widely seen as a turning point in efforts to pinpoint and remove bias in artificial intelligence. She joined Google later that year, and helped build the Ethical A.I. team.After hiring researchers like Dr. Gebru, Google has painted itself as a company dedicated to ?ethical? A.I. But it is often reluctant to publicly acknowledge flaws in its own systems.In an interview with The Times, Dr. Gebru said her exasperation stemmed from the company?s treatment of a research paper she had written with six other researchers, four of them at Google. The paper, also reviewed by The Times, pinpointed flaws in a new breed of language technology, including a system built by Google that underpins the company?s search engine.These systems learn the vagaries of language by analyzing enormous amounts of text, including thousands of books, Wikipedia entries and other online documents. Because this text includes biased and sometimes hateful language, the technology may end up generating biased and hateful language.After she and the other researchers submitted the paper to an academic conference, Dr. Gebru said, a Google manager demanded that she either retract the paper from the conference or remove her name and the names of the other Google employees. She refused to do so without further discussion and, in the email sent Tuesday evening, said she would resign after an appropriate amount of time if the company could not explain why it wanted her to retract the paper and answer other concerns.The company responded to her email, she said, by saying it could not meet her demands and that her resignation was accepted immediately. Her access to company email and other services was immediately revoked.In his note to employees, Mr. Dean said Google respected ?her decision to resign.? Mr. Dean also said that the paper did not acknowledge recent research showing ways of mitigating bias in such systems.?It was dehumanizing,? Dr. Gebru said. ?They may have reasons for shutting down our research. But what is most upsetting is that they refuse to have a discussion about why.?Dr. Gebru?s departure from Google comes at a time when A.I. technology is playing a bigger role in nearly every facet of Google?s business. The company has hitched its future to artificial intelligence ? whether with its voice-enabled digital assistant or its automated placement of advertising for marketers ? as the breakthrough technology to make the next generation of services and devices smarter and more capable.Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Alphabet, Google?s parent company, has compared the advent of artificial intelligence to that of electricity or fire, and has said that it is essential to the future of the company and computing. Earlier this year, Mr. Pichai called for greater regulation and responsible handling of artificial intelligence, arguing that society needs to balance potential harms with new opportunities.Google has repeatedly committed to eliminating bias in its systems. The trouble, Dr. Gebru said, is that most of the people making the ultimate decisions are men. ?They are not only failing to prioritize hiring more people from minority communities, they are quashing their voices,? she said.Julien Cornebise, an honorary associate professor at University College London and a former researcher with DeepMind, a prominent A.I. lab owned by the same parent company as Google?s, was among many artificial intelligence researchers who said Dr. Gebru?s departure reflected a larger problem in the industry.?This shows how some large tech companies only support ethics and fairness and other A.I.-for-social-good causes as long as their positive P.R. impact outweighs the extra scrutiny they bring,? he said. ?Timnit is a brilliant researcher.

Dec-20,"More than 1,200 Google employees and more than 1,500 academic researchers are speaking out in protest after a prominent Black scientist studying the ethics of artificial intelligence said she was fired by Google after the company attempted to suppress her research and she criticized its diversity efforts.Timnit Gebru, who was the technical co-lead of Google?s Ethical AI team, wrote on Twitter on Wednesday that she had been fired after sending an email to an internal group for women and allies working in the company?s AI unit.The email, which was first published by the tech newsletter Platformer, referenced a dispute over a research paper, but more broadly expressed frustration at Google?s diversity programs. In it, Gebru argued that ?there is zero accountability? or real incentive for Google leadership to change. ?Your life gets worse when you start advocating for underrepresented people, you start making the other leaders upset,? Gebru wrote. ?There is no way more documents or more conversations will achieve anything.?Gebru is one of the most well-known and respected Black female scientists working in AI. Before joining Google, she co-authored a widely cited 2018 paper that found higher error rates in facial analysis technology for women with darker skin tones. She also co-founded the non-profit Black in AI that aims to increase representation of people of color in the field.The dispute over Gebru?s research arose in November, when a senior manager at Google told Gebru that she would have to either retract or remove her name from a paper she had co-authored, Gebru told Wired. The paper, co-authored by researchers inside and outside Google, contended that technology companies could do more to ensure AI systems aimed at mimicking human writing and speech do not exacerbate historical gender biases and use of offensive language, according to a draft copy seen by Reuters.?I felt like we were being censored and thought this had implications for all of ethical AI research,? she told Wired. ?You?re not going to have papers that make the company happy all the time and don?t point out problems. That?s antithetical to what it means to be that kind of researcher.?Gebru told Wired that she attempted to negotiate with Google, offering to remove her name from the paper in exchange for a full explanation of the company?s objections, as well as a discussion of a better process for handling such matters in the future. If the company declined, she would arrange to leave at a later date.Google rejected her request, and ? after Gebru sent the frustrated email about diversity efforts ? the company emailed her team to say it had accepted her resignation. They also cut off her access to company email, Gebru said. Google has maintained that Gebru resigned.Gebru?s abrupt departure sent shockwaves through Google and the broader AI research community. Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP?s Legal Defense and Educational Fund, wrote on Twitter that Gebru?s firing was ?absolutely infuriating? and ?a disaster?. More than 1,200 Google employees and more than 1,500 supporters from academia and civil society signed a letter of protest.?The termination is an act of retaliation against Dr Gebru, and it heralds danger for people working for ethical and just AI ? especially Black people and People of Color ? across Google,? read the letter, published by the group that organized a walkout at Google over the company?s treatment of sexual harassment and gender discrimination.?Research integrity can no longer be taken for granted in Google?s corporate research environment, and Dr Gebru?s firing has overthrown a working understanding of what kind of research Google will permit. This is also a moment of reckoning beyond Google.?Gebru?s abrupt departure adds to years of angst, including several resignations and firings, in the AI department and other organizations at Google over diversity and whether the company?s efforts to minimize the potential harms of its services are sufficient.Just Wednesday, the National Labor Relations Board issued a complaint accusing Google of unlawfully monitoring and questioning several workers who were then fired for protesting against company policies and trying to organize a union.Jeff Dean, head of Google?s AI unit, told staff in an email obtained by Platformer that the research paper ?didn?t meet our bar for publication?. Dean, who is white and male, also addressed Gebru?s email to the women and allies group, writing: ?I also feel badly that hundreds of you received an email just this week from Timnit telling you to stop work on critical DEI programs. Please don?t.?On Friday, Dean released a longer statement about Gebru?s termination, which he continued to call a resignation. In it, he reiterated his argument that the paper did not include enough references to efforts Google has made to lessen the environmental impacts of computing or its attempts to mitigate bias in AI.Google declined to comment beyond Dean?s statement.",0.092019774,"google 0.0439, gebru 0.0344, company 0.0212, research 0.0175, email 0.0156, paper 0.0156, tell 0.0119, fire 0.0118, also 0.0100, work 0.0100"
Dec-20,"Timnit Gebru, one of Google?s top artificial intelligence researchers, says the company abruptly fired her yesterday. The technical co-lead of Google?s Ethical Artificial Intelligence Team claims managers were upset about an email she?d sent to colleagues.The email, which was sent to the Brain Women and Allies listserv, voiced frustration that managers were trying to get Gebru to retract a research paper. The full text was first published in Platformer. ?A week before you go out on vacation, you see a meeting pop up at 4:30pm PST on your calendar,? it reads. ?Then in that meeting your manager?s manager tells you ?it has been decided? that you need to retract this paper by next week... You are not worth having any conversations about this, since you are not someone whose humanity (let alone expertise recognized by journalists, governments, scientists, civic organizations such as the electronic frontiers foundation etc) is acknowledged or valued in this company.?After the email went out, Gebru told managers that certain conditions had to be met in order for her to stay at the company. Otherwise, she would have to work on a transition plan.Megan Kacholia, vice president of engineering at Google Research, said she could not meet the conditions and accepted Gebru?s resignation as a result, according to OneZero. Kacholia added, ?However, we believe the end of your employment should happen faster than your email reflects because certain aspects of the email you sent last night to non-management employees in the brain group reflect behavior that is inconsistent with the expectations of a Google manager,? according to Gebru. On Twitter, she claimed the decision to fire her ultimately came from Google?s head of AI, Jeff Dean.Dean sent an email to Google staff Thursday morning explaining his view Gebru?s departure, which was first obtained and published by Platformer.?Timnit co-authored a paper with four fellow Googlers as well as some external collaborators that needed to go through our review process (as is the case with all externally submitted papers),? the email reads. ?Unfortunately, this particular paper was only shared with a day?s notice before its deadline ? we require two weeks for this sort of review ? and then instead of awaiting reviewer feedback, it was approved for submission and submitted. A cross functional team then reviewed the paper as part of our regular process and the authors were informed that it didn?t meet our bar for publication and were given feedback about why...We acknowledge that the authors were extremely disappointed with the decision that Megan and I ultimately made, especially as they?d already submitted the paper.?The Google Walkout Twitter account, which is run by current and former employees, came out in force for Gebru. ?Dr. Gebru is a pathbreaking scientist doing some of the most important work to ensure just and accountable AI and to create a welcoming and diverse AI research field,? they wrote.Gebru is famous for her work on algorithmic bias, particularly in facial recognition technology. In 2018, she co-authored a paper with Joy Buolamwini showing error rates for identifying darker-skinned people were far higher than the error rates for identifying white-skinned people, in part because the datasets used to train algorithms were overwhelmingly white.News of Gebru?s alleged firing swept through Twitter yesterday, prompting an outpouring of support from colleagues and collaborators. ?I have your back as you have always had mine,? Buolamwini tweeted. ?You are brilliant and respected. You listen to those others readily ignore. You ask hard questions not to advance yourself but to uplift the communities we owe our foundations. I am proud to call you leader mentor friend sister.?Hours earlier, news broke about the National Labor Relations Board filing a complaint against Google for firing two workers last year in the wake of employee organizing efforts. At the time, Google said the employees, Laurence Berland and Kathryn Spiers, had violated security policies and internal systems.

Dec-20,"California asked to join the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust lawsuit against Google on Friday, making the state's attorney general the first Democrat to openly support the litigation.The department in October accused the $1 trillion California-based company of illegally using its market muscle to hobble rivals, and was joined by 11 other states when it was filed.""California is not making substantive changes to the complaint. In particular, California is not seeking to add any new facts or claims,"" Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in the filing, adding that it would not delay the case.Google has denied wrongdoing, and the company has said that its search engine and other products are dominant because consumers prefer them.""People use Google because they choose to, not because they're forced to, or because they can't find alternatives,"" a Google spokeswoman said.

Dec-20,"When Google unceremoniously ousted Black researcher Timnit Gebru, she felt targeted.""My theory is that they had wanted me out for a while because I spoke up a lot about issues related to black people, women, and marginalization,"" Gebru said in an interview on NPR's Morning Edition.At Google, Gebru was the co-lead of the company's Ethical Artificial Intelligence team, where she was able to parlay her passion for highlighting the societal effects of AI into academic papers that could shape Google's largest products, like search.Gebru co-founded Black in AI, a group formed to encourage people of color to pursue careers in artificial intelligence research.For Google, bringing on Gebru lent credibility to the tech giant's efforts in examining how technology can exacerbate systemic bias and discrimination. Yet she says Google's support for Gebru only went so far.""They wanted to have my presence, but not me exactly. They wanted to have the idea of me being at Google, but not the reality of me being at Google,"" Gebru said.On Wednesday, several of her former colleagues wrote a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai asking that Gebru be reinstated, saying her departure has ""had a demoralizing effect on the whole of our team."" The researchers also asked that they not be subject to retaliation for supporting Gebru.That fear is not unfounded. Google has a history of demoting and firing dissenting employees.In 2018, tens of thousands of employees walked off the job to protest how Google handled sexual harassment cases, among other issues. Organizers say the company pushed them out.More recently, the National Labor Relations Board accused Google of breaking the law by sacking employees who tried to unionize.""Google built this whole company up on the idea that we'll give you free food and a free coffee and pay you well and give you comfortable bean bags to work on as long as you toe the company line,"" said William Fitzgerald, who spent a decade at Google working on communications.Google's official company policy is: ""if you see something that you think isn't right ? speak up!""What the policy does not state, according to Fitzgerald, is that speaking up can also mean being shown the door.""Anyone who continues to challenge their power will get squashed or pushed out, and this is something that's been happening at Google for years now and we're only now hearing about it,"" he said.Inside Google, women of color and other underrepresented groups who looked up to Gebru have been especially shaken, said former Google employee Ifeoma Ozoma.""There are serious concerns around her identity as a Black woman and the concerns she raised around diversity as being the main driver for both the firing and the way it was done and the speed,"" Ozoma said.Google CEO Pichai wrote to staff that he is aware the episode has ""seeded doubts and led some in our community to question their place at Google."" He apologized for that. And committed to fix it.oogle declined to be interviewed for this story. It points to emails in which executives say they vigorously support free thinking and independent research.But now even that is up for debate. Before she left Google, the company abruptly asked Gebru to retract a research paper critical of Google's technology.Linguist Emily Bender at the University of Washington, who was one of her co-authors, said she feels for researchers inside Google right now.""I can't imagine that it wouldn't have a chilling effect on people who are working there trying to work on this but now looking over their shoulder wondering, 'When is something all of a sudden going to be retracted?' and their work going to be basically taken away from them?"" Bender said.After Google demanded that Gebru retract the paper for not meeting the company's bar for publication, Gebru asked that the process be explained to her, including a list of everyone who was part of the decision. If Google refused, Gebru said she would talk to her manager about ""a last date.""Google took that to mean Gebru offered to resign, and Google leadership say they accepted, but Gebru herself said no such offer was ever extended, only threatened.Gebru learned that Google had let her go while she was on a vacation road trip across the country.Former Googler Leslie Miley said he does not believe Google would have handled it the same way if Gebru were a white man.""You fired a Black woman over her private email while she was on vacation,"" Miley said. ""This is how tech treats Black women and other underrepresented people.""At Google, Gebru's former team laid out in their letter to Pichai what is needed: ""swift and structural changes if this work is to continue, and if the legitimacy of the field as a whole is to persevere.""",0.010254804,"google 0.0603, gebru 0.0401, company 0.0152, work 0.0131, black 0.0130, people 0.0089, ask 0.0089, former 0.0089, women 0.0069"
Dec-20,"Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Google?s parent company Alphabet, apologized for the departure of a prominent artificial intelligence researcher, whose exit has roiled the company?s work force and raised questions about its stated commitment to diversity and the responsible development of A.I. technology.In an email to employees on Wednesday, Mr. Pichai, however, stopped short of saying that the company was wrong in how it hastened the resignation of Timnit Gebru, who was a co-leader of Google?s Ethical A.I. team and one of its best-known Black female employees.Dr. Gebru said last week that the company fired her after she sent an email that criticized the company?s lack of progress in hiring women and minorities as well as biases built into its artificial intelligence technology. She said that she had demanded an explanation for why the company had told her to retract a paper that pinpointed flaws in a new breed of language technology, including a system built by Google that underpins the company?s search engine.She said that short of a transparent explanation or further discussion that she would resign after an appropriate amount of time. The company immediately accepted her statement as a resignation and cut her off from all company services and systems.Colleagues have rallied to Dr. Gebru?s defense, saying that Google did not treat her fairly and that this incident was an example of how Black employees are often mistreated at the company.?I?ve heard the reaction to Dr. Gebru?s departure loud and clear: It seeded doubts and led some in our community to question their place at Google. I want to say how sorry I am for that, and I accept the responsibility of working to restore your trust,? Mr. Pichai wrote in an email viewed by The New York Times. Axios had reported about the email earlier.?We need to assess the circumstances that led to Dr. Gebru?s departure, examining where we could have improved and led a more respectful process,? he added. ?We will begin a review of what happened to identify all the points where we can learn.?On Twitter, Dr. Gebru said Mr. Pichai?s email was not a true apology. ?I see this as ?I?m sorry for how it played out but I?m not sorry for what we did to her yet.??The parting with Dr. Gebru is especially fraught for Google, because it involves two thorny subjects for the company ? a lack of diversity in its work force and concerns about the dangerous consequences of artificial intelligence technology.Dr. Gebru, who joined the company last year from Stanford, was vocal about the importance of the company?s efforts to hire and retain more women as well as Black employees, who currently account for less than 2 percent of the company?s work force. In addition, her research to examine the long-term implications of A.I. put her at odds with the company?s strategic goals of depending on artificial intelligence as the breakthrough technology to improve most, if not all, of its products.Last week, about 2,000 Google employees signed a petition protesting her dismissal from the company and demanding that executives within its research organization be more transparent about the circumstances of Dr. Gebru?s exit.On Monday, members of Google?s Ethical A.I. team published a post that disputed some of the company?s statements regarding her exit, including the company?s assertion that she resigned and was not fired.Jeff Dean, one of Google?s most senior executives who oversees the company?s A.I. research arm, met with a group of employees on Tuesday to explain what took place with Dr. Gebru, but many walked away from the meeting even more upset.",0.042026515,"company 0.0535, gebru 0.0286, google 0.0259, employees 0.0176, technology 0.0148, email 0.0147, intelligence 0.0120, work 0.0120, artificial 0.0120"

Dec-20," Alphabet Inc?s Google this year moved to tighten control over its scientists? papers by launching a ?sensitive topics? review, and in at least three cases requested authors refrain from casting its technology in a negative light, according to internal communications and interviews with researchers involved in the work.Google?s new review procedure asks that researchers consult with legal, policy and public relations teams before pursuing topics such as face and sentiment analysis and categorizations of race, gender or political affiliation, according to internal webpages explaining the policy.?Advances in technology and the growing complexity of our external environment are increasingly leading to situations where seemingly inoffensive projects raise ethical, reputational, regulatory or legal issues,? one of the pages for research staff stated. Reuters could not determine the date of the post, though three current employees said the policy began in June.Google declined to comment for this story.The ?sensitive topics? process adds a round of scrutiny to Google?s standard review of papers for pitfalls such as disclosing of trade secrets, eight current and former employees said.For some projects, Google officials have intervened in later stages. A senior Google manager reviewing a study on content recommendation technology shortly before publication this summer told authors to ?take great care to strike a positive tone,? according to internal correspondence read to Reuters.The manager added, ?This doesn?t mean we should hide from the real challenges? posed by the software.Subsequent correspondence from a researcher to reviewers shows authors ?updated to remove all references to Google products.? A draft seen by Reuters had mentioned Google-owned YouTube.Four staff researchers, including senior scientist Margaret Mitchell, said they believe Google is starting to interfere with crucial studies of potential technology harms.?If we are researching the appropriate thing given our expertise, and we are not permitted to publish that on grounds that are not in line with high-quality peer review, then we?re getting into a serious problem of censorship,? Mitchell said.Google states on its public-facing website that its scientists have ?substantial? freedom.Tensions between Google and some of its staff broke into view this month after the abrupt exit of scientist Timnit Gebru, who led a 12-person team with Mitchell focused on ethics in artificial intelligence software (AI).Gebru says Google fired her after she questioned an order not to publish research claiming AI that mimics speech could disadvantage marginalized populations. Google said it accepted and expedited her resignation. It could not be determined whether Gebru?s paper underwent a ?sensitive topics? review.Google Senior Vice President Jeff Dean said in a statement this month that Gebru?s paper dwelled on potential harms without discussing efforts underway to address them.Dean added that Google supports AI ethics scholarship and is ?actively working on improving our paper review processes, because we know that too many checks and balances can become cumbersome.??SENSITIVE TOPICS?The explosion in research and development of AI across the tech industry has prompted authorities in the United States and elsewhere to propose rules for its use. Some have cited scientific studies showing that facial analysis software and other AI can perpetuate biases or erode privacy.Google in recent years incorporated AI throughout its services, using the technology to interpret complex search queries, decide recommendations on YouTube and autocomplete sentences in Gmail. Its researchers published more than 200 papers in the last year about developing AI responsibly, among more than 1,000 projects in total, Dean said.Studying Google services for biases is among the ?sensitive topics? under the company?s new policy, according to an internal webpage. Among dozens of other ?sensitive topics? listed were the oil industry, China, Iran, Israel, COVID-19, home security, insurance, location data, religion, self-driving vehicles, telecoms and systems that recommend or personalize web content.The Google paper for which authors were told to strike a positive tone discusses recommendation AI, which services like YouTube employ to personalize users? content feeds. A draft reviewed by Reuters included ?concerns? that this technology can promote ?disinformation, discriminatory or otherwise unfair results? and ?insufficient diversity of content,? as well as lead to ?political polarization.?The final publication instead says the systems can promote ?accurate information, fairness, and diversity of content.? The published version, entitled ?What are you optimizing for? Aligning Recommender Systems with Human Values,? omitted credit to Google researchers. Reuters could not determine why.A paper this month on AI for understanding a foreign language softened a reference to how the Google Translate product was making mistakes following a request from company reviewers, a source said. The published version says the authors used Google Translate, and a separate sentence says part of the research method was to ?review and fix inaccurate translations.?For a paper published last week, a Google employee described the process as a ?long-haul,? involving more than 100 email exchanges between researchers and reviewers, according to the internal correspondence.The researchers found that AI can cough up personal data and copyrighted material - including a page from a ?Harry Potter? novel - that had been pulled from the internet to develop the system.A draft described how such disclosures could infringe copyrights or violate European privacy law, a person familiar with the matter said. Following company reviews, authors removed the legal risks, and Google published the paper.",0.048901515,"google 0.0354, paper 0.0158, review 0.0156, researchers 0.0111, publish 0.0111, topics 0.0110, author 0.0096, technology 0.0095, sensitive 0.0095"
Dec-20,"Government contracting records show that between February 2017 and July 2020 Orbital was given $10 million to develop AI technology for a Defense Department program called Datahub. The Datahub would take satellite imagery and ?track enemy patterns of life 24/7, all weather and day/night across large areas of responsibility at machine speed,? according to Pentagon budget documents. The resulting intelligence would be used to speed up a DoD tactical approach known as Find-Fix-Finish-Exploit-Analyze (F3EA), whereby a target is found, tracked, captured or killed, interrogated and then an analysis done to determine future opportunities. Intelligence derived from Datahub would also be used to automate the Defense Department?s weapons deployment ?for timely precision strikes.?The investments threaten to be problematic for Google and Alphabet ? even when done at arm?s remove through its ?independent? venture capital wing. Google has repeatedly stumbled trying to live up to the expectations of its idealistic workforce. There was Project Maven and there was Project Dragonfly in 2017, when Google planned a search tool that came with built-in Chinese censorship. Then there were internal protests over contracts with the immigration agencies helping enact the Trump administration?s policies in 2019. Just this December, the exit of Google researcher Timnit Gebru, who was investigating potential racial bias in AI, led to a public fracas. Gebru claimed she?d been fired for posting frustrations about the retraction of one of her papers. More than 2,500 Google employees have signed a petition demanding their employer be transparent about Gebru?s termination.A Google spokesperson said: ?When we do our due diligence before any investment, we work with entrepreneurs to understand their tech, business plans and team, and, where appropriate, look for consistency with the AI Principles we announced in 2018.?More than two years ago, Google?s CEO Sundar Pichai promised to no longer use his company?s artificial intelligence expertise to develop weapons. But that hasn?t stopped Google?s parent company, Alphabet, where Pichai is also CEO, from investing in a couple of companies that are getting into the business of war.________________________________________In June 2018, Google CEO Sundar Pichai made a sweeping promise. In a blog entitled ?AI at Google: our principles,? Pichai said Google would not develop artificial intelligence for ?weapons or other technologies whose principal purpose or implementation is to cause or directly facilitate injury to people.?Pichai?s pledge hadn?t come out of the blue: earlier that year, employees protested the company?s participation in Project Maven, a Department of Defense (DOD) initiative worth a reported potential $250 million a year - and $15 million over 18 months to Google - to use AI to identify buildings and other targets ?of interest? to the military from drone footage. Insiders at the Mountain View-based giant fumed. More than three thousand signed a letter to Pichai, writing, ?We believe that Google should not be in the business of war.? Google eventually let the contract lapse.Pichai may have promised Google AI wouldn?t harm people, but he said nothing about Google?s parent company Alphabet. In late 2019, Pichai became CEO of Alphabet while still retaining his job as CEO of Google ? and through investments by Google and its venture capital wing, GV (formerly Google Ventures), Alphabet is still very much in the business of war.GV positions itself as an ?independent, return-driven fund? with $5 billion under management. But the Mountain View, Calif.-based firm was spun out of Google back in 2009 and it?s all Alphabet money. As it says on its website, ?GV is the venture capital arm of Alphabet,? and Alphabet is the firm?s ?sole limited partner.? (GV and Pichai declined repeated requests for comment on this story.)Both Google and GV have minority stakes in companies supplying military surveillance tools. In 2016 GV acquired a stake in Palo Alto-based Orbital Insight and in 2017 Google took equity in Planet, headquartered in San Francisco. Together, in the last three years, the two firms have won at least $30.5 million in Defense Department contracts, alongside deals with space intelligence agencies, for projects that could be said to ?directly facilitate injury.?Orbital is a software company founded by former Google Books director James Crawford. Its AI sifts through masses of satellite images, drone footage and aggregated smartphone location data from 800 million devices across the world with the goal of telling customers what?s physically changed on Earth and why it matters. The uses are myriad. Orbital could, for instance, track North Korean nuclear sites or the Taliban building training camps. But it also has peaceful uses like monitoring deforestation in the Amazon and mapping watersheds or sprawling urban slums. It gets its satellite footage from a range of providers, including Planet, its Google-portfolio sibling.Planet, which was founded by NASA engineers, has 150 imaging satellites in orbit, claiming they make up the world?s largest constellation of Earth-imaging satellites. Planet?s big sell is the ability to quickly and cheaply send up small satellites into space. It has Doves - about the size of a loaf of bread - and Skysat satellites - about the size of a minifridge. Both are capable of beaming high-quality imagery back to earth. The startup was valued at nearly $1.8 billion after a 2018 funding round, according to PitchBook data. Google acquired 16% of the company, after selling its satellite imaging subsidiary Terra Bella to Planet in 2017, which has now diluted to 13%.Both companies work with the U.S. military and various intelligence agencies. Planet has contracts with space intel agencies, including the National Reconnaissance Office and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, a DOD combat support agency. Orbital bid for work on that controversial Project Maven, according to two former employees.as been involved in every Orbital fundraising round since the satellite imagery company was founded in 2013. GV participated in a $9 million Series A round in 2015 and then in 2016 led a $15 million equity investment as part of the Series B. It has invested in all four of Orbital?s raises, the most recent being a $50 million Series D in November 2019. In all, Orbital has raised $130 million, most recently at a valuation of $480 million, according to PitchBook data. Forbes estimates GV has a stake of roughly 13% in the startup, which Forbes named as a Next Billion-Dollar startup in 2017. Sequoia is the largest outside stakeholder at over 20%, according to a source familiar with the investments.From early on, Orbital has worked on humanitarian projects. With the World Bank it tries to quantify poverty by counting new buildings, roads and agricultural land in less-developed countries. It kept tabs on the world?s forests with the World Resources Institute. And as recently as last year its AI was monitoring the expansion of China?s ?re-education? camps in the Xinjiang region.But the big money in the geospatial game resides in government coffers and in addition to its altruistic work, Orbital has forged numerous ties with U.S. intelligence and military agencies. In-Q-Tel, the CIA?s investment arm, provided $5 million of financing (via a warrant) in 2015. Shortly after a handful of In-Q-Tel employees moved over to Orbital and the fund?s managing partner George Hoyem became a board observer, according to Crunchbase. Among Orbital?s advisors for federal government business is Robert Cardillo, former director of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. And in late 2019, it signed a deal with Booz Allen Hamilton, the Beltway consultancy with deep ties to the intelligence community, to supply its tools at speed via Booz?s Modzy, a kind of app store for government AI services.Not everyone inside Orbital was happy about its ties to the military. Orbital?s own ethics pledge states, ?We do not develop or condone any intent to harm humanity, the environment, and/or society.? According to one former senior staffer, Orbital said its tech wouldn?t be applied to things like ?bomb targeting,? but ?once you identify?a building, [the government] is gonna do whatever they want with it.? Though they didn?t have issues with the ethics of working with the military, they felt it ?silly to make up these fake rules? just call it what it is.? The ex-employee added that the company went from ?saving chimpanzees in Indonesia? to ?finding targets in Afghanistan.?A former software engineer added that the defense work was ?a big problem because there's a lot of money in doing things that some people might consider unethical.? The ex-staffer said that in Silicon Valley it?s ?hard to attract employees here to a company that's going to be... dependent on the U.S. military.? They acknowledged that the business had tried to steer clear of ?the bad stuff, but if you?ve borrowed $120 million from other people, you're kind of pressured to deliver on it.?Orbital declined to provide any executives for an interview. A spokesperson for Orbital said ?a few employees... expressed concern over government work,? but added that the company has an ethics board, led by founder Crawford, that reviews each contract. When a government wanted to fly drones past ships and use Orbital for facial recognition, for instance, Orbital declined to do the work, as it doesn?t track individuals. The spokesperson added that it had ?successfully completed? its work on the Datahub program, but declined to offer more detail or comment on any possible breaches of its own ethics stance.Regarding its overall Pentagon work, the spokesperson added: ""Orbital Insight's work with the U.S. Department of Defense helps the agency zoom in on the physical world and monitor global activity so they can avoid surprises and proactively address critical situations. Precise change detection and an accurate picture of what's happening on the ground are essential for keeping our country safe and secure with effective security responses and communication.""Orbital may no longer work on Datahub (former senior employees say the company lost the contract), but the startup continues to actively seek out government work. Official records show that since 2018, Orbital has spent $300,000 on Congressional lobbying, talking to lawmakers about the uses of geospatial AI. And in July 2020, it signed its biggest publicly-known government contract to date: a $22 million deal with Customs and Border Protection (CBP), details of which were obtained by Jack Poulson, an ex-Stanford math professor who used to work at Google until he resigned over the Chinese search engine plans, and now runs big tech research outfit Tech Inquiry. The contract documents, obtained via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, indicate that CBP is using Orbital tools to analyze data coming from drones, surveillance balloons and satellites that monitor radio frequency signals. According to contract records, Orbital?s border work will mix classic ?geospatial surveillance? with search and rescue aid, the latter covered by a separate $3 million contract. An Orbital spokesperson said it was a research and development project with CBP looking ?to prevent loss of life for people stranded along the southern border and provide officers with more situational awareness in remote areas.? A CBP spokesperson said the ?primary? use case was for search and rescue.Planet has raised even more money than Orbital, above $400 million since it was founded in 2010. Its Doves satellites, which catch rides into orbit on the backs of launches from the likes of SpaceX and Rocket Lab, monitor Earth?s entire landmass and large chunks of its oceans, including coastal parts of the South China Sea and the Persian Gulf, every day.Like Orbital, Planet?s business is a mix of humanitarian, private market and government contracting. Amongst its government projects are $20 million in National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency satellite imagery contracts. In the last three years, it?s completed a mix of studies and pilots with the Navy, the Air Force and the Army, looking at how best to use its satellite imagery across land and sea, in contracts worth more than $15 million.Planet is hoping to significantly expand its collaboration with U.S. intelligence in the coming years, by bidding on the lucrative EnhancedView contract. Managed by the National Reconnaissance Office, EnhancedView contractors provide the U.S. government with commercial satellite imagery. For the last ten years the bulk of the EnhancedView money has gone to satellite and geospatial intelligence provider Maxar Technologies, which makes $300 million a year from the deal. Currently Planet?s constellation of Skysats and Doves is being tested to see how they compare with Maxar?s satellites. ?We believe we will be able to offer an excellent level of performance and service to the U.S. government,? the Planet spokesperson added. As with Orbital, three former senior employees say there was some internal turmoil at Planet over its work with the military, claiming a small number of staff left as a result. ?Initially, they were very altruistic. They were launching satellites for the benefit of everybody in the world,? said one former staffer.  ?Then they discovered that actually, the only people that really want to pay the big money for satellite data is governments.? Another ex-employee said they thought Planet was against doing intelligence work but the pivot was a ?turn off? and one reason they left. Planet?s spokesperson said there was no such shift, that its first customers were with military and intelligence agencies, and it has ?no internal record of any employee ever leaving Planet because of our work with governments.? It pointed Forbes to the company?s ethics code in which it says: ?Our partners may not use our products to further actions that sponsor harm, abuse, aggression, violence, or other violations of human rights.? The company also has an Ethics Committee that ?reviews potential or existing customer engagements for ethical issues? and it has nixed potential private and public sector contracts because of moral concerns. Planet declined to provide any information on what those contracts were.A former Planet employee focused on government work said that the company was walking ?a fine line.? ?What their [ethics] statement says and then what the government does with the thing that they sell them is not really in their prerogative to control,? they added.All these tricky ethical quandaries haven?t stopped Pichai?s Alphabet companies from investing further in the geospatial market. GV is also backing a less-proven moonshot, participating in $40 million and $35 million rounds in 2018 and 2020 for SpinLaunch. The startup has a novel idea for getting satellites into orbit, using what amounts to a giant, spinning arm that hammer-throws satellites into space. Thanks to Alphabet?s money and a 2019 $2.5 million contract with the DoD?s Defense Innovation Unit Small Responsive Launch program, SpinLaunch?s as-yet unproven tech could soon be responsible for helping the Pentagon deploy even more military spy satellites to monitor the planet.When Pichai laid out his company?s AI principles, he took on a utilitarian tone in describing their protean limits. ?Where there is a material risk of harm, we will proceed only where we believe that the benefits substantially outweigh the risks, and will incorporate appropriate safety constraints,? he wrote. But it?s not within Google?s remit to apply those unspecified constraints on the companies in which it invests or their militaristic customers.",0.074750211,"orbital 0.0180, google 0.0173, satellite 0.0135, million 0.0134, work 0.0129, company 0.0128, contract 0.0117, planet 0.0115, government 0.0097"
Dec-20,"In 2000, just two years after it was founded, Google reached a milestone that would lay the foundation for its dominance over the next 20 years: It became the world?s largest search engine, with an index of more than one billion web pages.The rest of the internet never caught up, and Google?s index just kept on getting bigger. Today, it?s somewhere between 500 billion and 600 billion web pages, according to estimates.Now, as regulators around the world examine ways to curb Google?s power, including a search monopoly case expected from state attorneys general as early as this week and the antitrust lawsuit the Justice Department filed in October, they are wrestling with a company whose sheer size has allowed it to squash competitors. And those competitors are pointing investigators toward that enormous index, the gravitational center of the company.?If people are on a search engine with a smaller index, they?re not always going to get the results they want. And then they go to Google and stay at Google,? said Matt Wells, who started Gigablast, a search engine with an index of around five billion web pages, about 20 years ago. ?A little guy like me can?t compete.?Understanding how Google?s search works is a key to figuring out why so many companies find it nearly impossible to compete and, in fact, go out of their way to cater to its needs.Every search request provides Google with more data to make its search algorithm smarter. Google has performed so many more searches than any other search engine that it has established a huge advantage over rivals in understanding what consumers are looking for. That lead only continues to widen, since Google has a market share of about 90 percent.Google directs billions of users to locations across the internet, and websites, hungry for that traffic, create a different set of rules for the company. Websites often provide greater and more frequent access to Google?s so-called web crawlers ? computers that automatically scour the internet and scan web pages ? allowing the company to offer a more extensive and up-to-date index of what is available on the internet.When he was working at the music site Bandcamp, Zack Maril, a software engineer, became concerned about how Google?s dominance had made it so essential to websites.In 2018, when Google said its crawler, Googlebot, was having trouble with one of Bandcamp?s pages, Mr. Maril made fixing the problem a priority because Google was critical to the site?s traffic. When other crawlers encountered problems, Bandcamp would usually block them.Mr. Maril continued to research the different ways that websites opened doors for Google and closed them for others. Last year, he sent a 20-page report, ?Understanding Google,? to a House antitrust subcommittee and then met with investigators to explain why other companies could not recreate Google?s index.?It?s largely an unchecked source of power for its monopoly,? said Mr. Maril, 29, who works at another technology company that does not compete directly with Google. He asked that The New York Times not identify his employer since he was not speaking for it.A report this year by the House subcommittee cited Mr. Maril?s research on Google?s efforts to create a real-time map of the internet and how this had ?locked in its dominance.? While the Justice Department is looking to unwind Google?s business deals that put its search engine front and center on billions of smartphones and computers, Mr. Maril is urging the government to intervene and regulate Google?s index. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment.Websites and search engines are symbiotic. Websites rely on search engines for traffic, while search engines need access to crawl the sites to provide relevant results for users. But each crawler puts a strain on a website?s resources in server and bandwidth costs, and some aggressive crawlers resemble security risks that can take down a site.Since having their pages crawled costs money, websites have an incentive to let it be done only by search engines that direct enough traffic to them. In the current world of search, that leaves Google and ? in some cases ? Microsoft?s Bing.Google and Microsoft are the only search engines that spend hundreds of millions of dollars annually to maintain a real-time map of the English-language internet. That?s in addition to the billions they?ve spent over the years to build out their indexes, according to a report this summer from Britain?s Competition and Markets Authority.Google holds a significant leg up on Microsoft in more than market share. British competition authorities said Google?s index included about 500 billion to 600 billion web pages, compared with 100 billion to 200 billion for Microsoft.Other large tech companies deploy crawlers for other purposes. Facebook has a crawler for links that appear on its site or services. Amazon says its crawler helps improve its voice-based assistant, Alexa. Apple has its own crawler, Applebot, which has fueled speculation that it might be looking to build its own search engine.But indexing has always been a challenge for companies without deep pockets.The privacy-minded search engine DuckDuckGo decided to stop crawling the entire web more than a decade ago and now syndicates results from Microsoft. It still crawls sites like Wikipedia to provide results for answer boxes that appear in its results, but maintaining its own index does not usually make financial sense for the company.?It costs more money than we can afford,? said Gabriel Weinberg, chief executive of DuckDuckGo. In a written statement for the House antitrust subcommittee last year, the company said that ?an aspiring search engine start-up today (and in the foreseeable future) cannot avoid the need? to turn to Microsoft or Google for its search results.When FindX started to develop an alternative to Google in 2015, the Danish company set out to create its own index and offered a build-your-own algorithm to provide individualized results.FindX quickly ran into problems. Large website operators, such as Yelp and LinkedIn, did not allow the fledgling search engine to crawl their sites. Because of a bug in its code, FindX?s computers that crawled the internet were flagged as a security risk and blocked by a group of the internet?s largest infrastructure providers. What pages they did collect were frequently spam or malicious web pages.?If you have to do the indexing, that?s the hardest thing to do,? said Brian Schildt Laursen, one of the founders of FindX, which shut down in 2018.Mr. Schildt Laursen launched a new search engine last year, Givero, which offered users the option to donate a portion of the company?s revenue to charitable causes. When he started Givero, he syndicated search results from Microsoft.Most large websites are judicious about who can crawl their pages. In general, Google and Microsoft get more access because they have more users, while smaller search engines have to ask for permission.?You need the traffic to convince the websites to allow you to copy and crawl, but you also need the content to grow your index and pull up your traffic,? said Marc Al-Hames, a co-chief executive of Cliqz, a German search engine that closed this year after seven years of operation. ?It?s a chicken-and-egg problem.?In Europe, a group called the Open Search Foundation has proposed a plan to create a common internet index that can underpin many European search engines. It?s essential to have a diversity of options for search results, said Stefan Voigt, the group?s chairman and founder, because it is not good for only a handful of companies to determine what links people are shown and not shown.?We just can?t leave this to one or two companies,? Mr. Voigt said.When Mr. Maril started researching how sites treated Google?s crawler, he downloaded 17 million so-called robots.txt files ? essentially rules of the road posted by nearly every website laying out where crawlers can go ? and found many examples where Google had greater access than competitors.ScienceDirect, a site for peer-reviewed papers, permits only Google?s crawler to have access to links containing PDF documents. Only Google?s computers get access to listings on PBS Kids. On Alibaba.com, the U.S. site of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, only Google?s crawler is given access to pages that list products.This year, Mr. Maril started an organization, the Knuckleheads? Club (?because only a knucklehead would take on Google?), and a website to raise awareness about Google?s web-crawling monopoly.?Google has all this power in society,? Mr. Maril said. ?But I think there should be democratic ? small d ? control of that power.?",0.114774752,"google 0.0413, search 0.0317, index 0.0180, company 0.0171, page 0.0138, engine 0.0125, internet 0.0104, maril 0.0104, websites 0.0102"
Dec-20,"Google says it will examine the departure of a prominent Black female researcher in the field of ethics in artificial intelligence, whose recent, sudden exit has angered thousands of the company’s employees and others in the tech and academic communities.In a memo sent Wednesday to Google (GOOG) employees, CEO Sundar Pichai said the company needs to “assess the circumstances” that led up to Timnit Gebru leaving Google (GOOG) last week, and examine “where we could have improved and led a more respectful process.”“We will begin a review of what happened to identify all the points where we can learn — considering everything from de-escalation strategies to new processes we can put in place,” he wrote in a memo that was first posted online by news website Axios and has been confirmed as authentic by CNN Business. A Google spokeswoman said the company had no comment.Gebru is known for her research into bias and inequality in AI, and in particular for a 2018 paper she coauthored with Joy Buolamwini that highlighted how poorly commercial facial-recognition software fared when attempting to classify women and people of color. Their work sparked widespread awareness of issues common in AI today, particularly when the technology is tasked with identifying anything about human beings.Until early December, Gebru was the co-leader of Google’s ethical AI team, and one of very few Black employees at the company overall (3.7% of Google employees are Black, according to the company’s 2020 annual diversity report) — let alone in its AI division. The research scientist is also co-founder of the group Black in AI, which aims to increase representation of Black people in the field.On Wednesday, December 2, Gebru tweeted that she had been “immediately fired” for an email she recently sent to Google’s Brain Women and Allies internal mailing list. In the email she expressed dismay over the ongoing lack of diversity at the company and frustration over an internal process related to the review of a not-yet published research paper she coauthored about the risks of ever-larger AI language models that are trained on text from the internet.In later tweets, Gebru clarified that no one at Google explicitly told her that she was fired. Rather, she said Google would not meet a number of her conditions for returning and accepted her resignation immediately because it felt that her email reflected “behavior that is inconsistent with the expectations of a Google manager.”In an email sent to Google Research employees on December 3 that was posted publicly the following day, Jeff Dean, Google’s head of AI, told employees his perspective: that Gebru coauthored a paper but didn’t give the company the required two weeks to review it before its deadline. He also wrote Gebru responded with demands that had to be met if she were to remain at Google.Pichai said in the memo that he was sorry for how Gebru leaving Google has “seeded doubts and led some in our community to question their place” at the company. He did not apologize for the way her employment at Google ended.Gebru did not respond to a request for comment about the memo, but in a tweet she said she sees Pichai’s comment about seeding doubts as, “I’m sorry for how it played out but I’m not sorry for what we did to her yet.”In response to Gebru’s departure, which struck many of her colleagues as a failure by an industry titan to foster an environment supportive of diversity, over 2,200 Google employees and over 3,100 supporters in the academic and AI fields signed a Medium post decrying her departure and demanding transparency about Google’s decision regarding the research paper.Those sharing their support include numerous women who have fought inequality in the technology industry, such as Ellen Pao, CEO of Project Include and former CEO of Reddit; Ifeoma Ozoma, a former Google employee who founded Earthseed; and Meredith Whittaker, faculty director at the AI Now Institute and a core organizer of the 2018 Google Walkout, which protested sexual harassment and misconduct at the company.Others include Buolamwini, as well as Danielle Citron, a law professor who specializes in the study of online harassment at Boston University and a 2019 MacArthur Fellow.",0.039785354,"google 0.0441, gebru 0.0237, company 0.0214, employees 0.0168, black 0.0122, research 0.0122, memo 0.0100, paper 0.0100, email 0.0099"
Jan-21,"Google has threatened to remove its search engine from Australia and Facebook has threatened to remove news from its feed for all Australian users if a code forcing the companies to negotiate payments to news media companies goes ahead.The move would mean the 19 million Australians who use Google every month would no longer be able to use Google Search, and 17 million Australians who log into Facebook every month would not be able to see or post any news articles on the social media site.The two companies are fighting against legislation currently before the parliament that would force the digital platforms to enter into negotiations with news media companies for payment for content, with an arbiter to ultimately decide the payment amount if no agreement can be reached.On Friday, Google delivered an ultimatum to the government, saying it would not be viable to continue offering search in Australia if the code goes ahead.The company?s Australian managing director, Mel Silva, told a Senate committee the proposed news code was untenable and would set a ?dangerous precedent? for paying for links.?The principle of unrestricted linking between websites is fundamental to search and coupled with the unmanageable financial and operational risk if this version of the code were to become law, it would give us no real choice but to stop making Google Search available in Australia,? she said.?Withdrawing our services from Australia is the last thing that Google want to have happen, especially when there is another way forward.?Silva said the company wanted to make changes to the code to make it ?workable?, and the company was keen to enter into agreements with media companies to pay for content, pointing out around 450 deals have been made with media companies around the world.The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said at a press conference in Brisbane the government would not respond to threats.?Let me be clear. Australia makes our rules for things you can do in Australia. That?s done in our parliament. It?s done by our government. And that?s how things work here in Australia and people who want to work with that, in Australia, you?re very welcome.?But we don?t respond to threats.?Reset Australia, an organisation that is lobbying for the regulation of big tech companies, said Google was bullying Australia.?Today?s egregious threats show Google has the body of behemoth, but the brain of brat,? the executive director, Chris Cooper, said. ?When a private corporation tries to use its monopoly power to threaten and bully a sovereign nation, it?s a surefire sign that regulation is long overdue.?Representatives from Facebook repeated the company?s previous threat to pull news content from user feeds. Josh Machin, Facebook?s head of public policy in Australia, said if the code goes ahead, Facebook would potentially prevent not just news companies from posting links to news articles on Facebook, but all users based in Australia.Machin said news articles make up under 5% of what the average user sees in their feed, and Facebook did not get much commercial benefit from news articles posted on Facebook.When asked whether Facebook profited from fake news posted on the platform, Machin said no commercial benefit was gained by Facebook on its users posting fake news.The Guardian Australia managing director, Dan Stinton, told the committee the claims were misleading because news content keeps users engaged on Facebook.?The way you advertise on Facebook is within the Facebook newsfeed and news content does provide at least some of the engagement that the Facebook newsfeed delivers,? he said.?So I?m surprised that they say they see no value in journalism within the Facebook newsfeed.?Australia?s competition watchdog, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, developed the code. Its chair, Rod Sims, told the committee what was being lost in the debate was the code was not simply a requirement for Google and Facebook to pay per click for news articles.?Discussions we are aware of have focused on paying upfront lump-sum amounts, not per click,? he said.?What this code does is it gives the possibility of arbitration, which I suspect won?t be used that often, but that possibility evens up the bargaining process. This is really the only way we can get commercial deals.Labor?s shadow communications minister, Michelle Rowland, said it was concerning Google and Facebook believed the code was unworkable.?[The treasurer] Josh Frydenberg and [communications minister] Paul Fletcher need to explain why they can?t find a way to support the media without also disrupting the millions of Australians who use Google Search and Facebook every month,? she said.Google?s threat came on the same day the company signed an agreement with 300 French publications to pay them for their content appearing in search results.Senators repeatedly questioned Silva about what they said was a threat, asking whether it was simply about avoiding the precedent it would create worldwide for paying for news in search results.Silva denied it was a threat, just the ?worst case scenario? if the code went ahead.The independent senator Rex Patrick compared Google?s threat with China threatening Australia?s trade in response to the inquiry into Covid-19. He said Google?s response was not about ?breaking? search, but Google protecting its revenue.?It?s about breaking your bank account, that?s what this is about,? he said. ?It does not touch the internet and the way in which it works,? he said.Silva told the hearing that last year Google paid $59m in tax on profits before tax of $134m, and $4.8bn in revenue in Australia.Google paying Twitter to advertise a link to an article of ours on someone against the code that would require them to pay for links to articles. pic.twitter.com/Q8ncqfPKjw? Josh Taylor (@joshgnosis) January 21, 2021Facebook has called the code unworkable in its current form, and has asked for digital platforms to be given six months? grace to negotiate deals with news companies directly before being hit with the ?big stick? of the mandatory code.Stinton told the committee that the code is a ?pragmatic way? to facilitate negotiations between news media and the digital platforms, and argued the claim of opponents that the legislation would break an open internet ignored the internet had changed.?Opponents of the code are defending an open internet that ceased to exist years ago, and instead has become dominated by a small number of very, very large US tech companies,? he said.?In fact, Google and Facebook are the internet for most Australians, or at least the key gateway to it. Google has a monthly audience of 19 million, and Facebook of 17 million.?Where people go online is largely determined by these two companies? algorithms.?Nine has argued the digital platforms need to be regulated because they are monopolies within Australia, and should pay for news content because ?access to news content drives credibility for and value of the platforms?.Newswire service AAP has said it supports the code, but notes that as a wholesale news provider it would not directly benefit from the code so would need other government support.A poll released on Friday morning found three in five Australians believe social media companies should prioritise news websites in news feeds.Dynata polled 1,003 people on 14 and 15 January on behalf of the Australia Institute and found 62% of people agreed social media companies should prioritise journalism in user feeds, and 84% agreed they should be transparent about how their algorithms influence user feeds, and should take steps to stop the spread of misinformation.The poll found 75% believed anonymous accounts should be banned, but people aged over 60 were much more likely to call for a ban on anonymous accounts (88%) compared with those 18 to 29 (59%).",-0.008635531,"news 0.0290, facebook 0.0266, google 0.0238, australia 0.0228, code 0.0228, company 0.0227, would 0.0179, media 0.0117, search 0.0116"
Jan-21,"Parameters are the key to machine learning algorithms. They?re the part of the model that?s learned from historical training data. Generally speaking, in the language domain, the correlation between the number of parameters and sophistication has held up remarkably well. For example, OpenAI?s GPT-3 ? one of the largest language models ever trained, at 175 billion parameters ? can make primitive analogies, generate recipes, and even complete basic code.In what might be one of the most comprehensive tests of this correlation to date, Google researchers developed and benchmarked techniques they claim enabled them to train a language model containing more than a trillion parameters. They say their 1.6-trillion-parameter model, which appears to be the largest of its size to date, achieved an up to 4 times speedup over the previously largest Google-developed language model (T5-XXL).As the researchers note in aÿpaperÿdetailing their work, large-scale training is an effective path toward powerful models. Simple architectures, backed by large datasets and parameter counts, surpass far more complicated algorithms. But effective, large-scale training is extremely computationally intensive. That?s why the researchers pursued what they call the Switch Transformer, a ?sparsely activated? technique that uses only a subset of a model?s weights, or the parameters that transform input data within the model.The Switch Transformer builds on a mix of experts, an AI model paradigm first proposed in the early ?90s. The rough concept is to keep multiple experts, or models specialized in different tasks, inside a larger model and have a ?gating network? choose which experts to consult for any given data.The novelty of the Switch Transformer is that it efficiently leverages hardware designed for dense matrix multiplications ? mathematical operations widely used in language models ? such as GPUs and Google?s tensor processing units (TPUs). In the researchers? distributed training setup, their models split unique weights on different devices so the weights increased with the number of devices but maintained a manageable memory and computational footprint on each device.In an experiment, the researchers pretrained several different Switch Transformer models using 32 TPU cores on the Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus, a 750GB-sized dataset of text scraped from Reddit, Wikipedia, and other web sources. They tasked the models with predicting missing words in passages where 15% of the words had been masked out, as well as other challenges, like retrieving text to answer a list of increasingly difficult questions.The researchers claim their 1.6-trillion-parameter model with 2,048 experts (Switch-C) exhibited ?no training instability at all,? in contrast to a smaller model (Switch-XXL) containing 395 billion parameters and 64 experts. However, on one benchmark ? the Sanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) ? Switch-C scored lower (87.7) versus Switch-XXL (89.6), which the researchers attribute to the opaque relationship between fine-tuning quality, computational requirements, and the number of parameters.This being the case, the Switch Transformer led to gains in a number of downstream tasks. For example, it enabled an over 7 times pretraining speedup while using the same amount of computational resources, according to the researchers, who demonstrated that the large sparse models could be used to create smaller, dense models fine-tuned on tasks with 30% of the quality gains of the larger model. In one test where a Switch Transformer model was trained to translate between over 100 different languages, the researchers observed ?a universal improvement? across 101 languages, with 91% of the languages benefitting from an over 4 times speedup compared with a baseline model.?Though this work has focused on extremely large models, we also find that models with as few as two experts improve performance while easily fitting within memory constraints of commonly available GPUs or TPUs,? the researchers wrote in the paper. ?We cannot fully preserve the model quality, but compression rates of 10 to 100 times are achievable by distilling our sparse models into dense models while achieving ~30% of the quality gain of the expert model.?In future work, the researchers plan to apply the Switch Transformer to ?new and across different modalities,? including image and text. They believe that model sparsity can confer advantages in a range of different media, as well asÿmultimodal models.Unfortunately, the researchers? work didn?t take into account the impact of these large language models in the real world. Models often amplify the biases encoded in this public data; a portion of the training data is not uncommonly sourced from communities withÿpervasiveÿgender, race, and religious prejudices. AI research firm OpenAI notes that this can lead to placing words like ?naughty? or ?sucked? near female pronouns and ?Islam? near words like ?terrorism.?ÿ Other studies, like one published in April by Intel, MIT, and Canadian AI initiative CIFAR researchers, have found high levels of stereotypical bias from some of the most popular models, includingÿGoogle?s BERTÿandÿXLNet,ÿOpenAI?s GPT-2, andÿFacebook?s RoBERTa. This bias could be leveraged by malicious actors to foment discord by spreading misinformation, disinformation, and outright lies that ?radicalize individuals into violent far-right extremist ideologies andIt?s unclear whether Google?s policies on published machine learning research might have played a role in this.ÿReutersÿreported late last year that researchers at the company are now required to consult with legal, policy, and public relations teams before pursuing topics such as face and sentiment analysis and categorizations of race, gender, or political affiliation. And in early December, GoogleÿfiredÿAI ethicist Timnit Gebru, reportedly in part over a research paper on large language models that discussed risks, including the impact of their carbon footprint on marginalized communities and their tendency to perpetuate abusive language, hate speech, microaggressions, stereotypes, and other dehumanizing language aimed at specific groups of people.",0.049602373,"model 0.0524, researchers 0.0219, switch 0.0173, train 0.0143, language 0.0142, parameters 0.0112, large 0.0112, transformer 0.0111, experts 0.0097, different 0.0097"
Jan-21,"Googleÿhas not updated a single app on its roster, for theÿApple iPhone, for four weeks or more now. That, in this day and age, is an abnormally long time to leave an app untouched without updates, bug fixes or functionality tweaks. Unless all of Google?s apps for the iPhone are absolutely perfect and perfection doesn?t need any updates, it seems a tad perplexing why this is happening. At the time of writing this, popular apps including Google Search,ÿGmail, Google Chrome, Maps, Google Drive, Google Docs,ÿGoogle Meet,ÿYouTubeÿand Google Pay have not been updated for 4 weeks or more, for the Apple iPhone and Apple iPad. Which means the last updates arrived in early December 2020, that is December 7 or before. Hold on for a second, that somehow coincides with the rollout ofÿApple?s mandatory privacy labelsÿfor all apps updated post December 8, 2020?The new privacy labels which are now part of every app listing on the Apple App Store for iPhone, iPad and Mac, is designed to give users a quick glance at what data each app collects from you and what it doesn?t. he idea is to make it simpler for users to know, before the download an app, exactly what data the app will require for tracking, what data will be linked to you and what is not. The thing is, if Google had rolled out an update for any app on or post December 8, these privacy labels would have had to be populated for the update to be available on the App Store. At this time, none of Google?s popular apps have this data filled on the listings page in the App Store.A quick glance over at the Google Play Store forÿAndroidÿphones reveals that most of Google?s popular apps have indeed been updated for Android phones. Gmail was last updated on December 10 with the release notes saying, ?Bug fixes and performance improvements?. Google Photos for Android was last updated on December 21, 2020 while YouTube was also updated on December 10. Google Meet was last updated on December 9 with improved support for 250 person meetings, real-time captions, international dial-in numbers for any meeting as well as bug fixes and performance improvements. That being said, even the Android version of apps such as Google Docs, Google Drive, Google Chrome and Google Maps for Android haven?t been updated since December 8.TheÿApp StoreÿPrivacy Labels will have three sections?Data used to track you, data linked to you and data that is not linked to you. Under each section will be bullet points listing the exact specifics about the data being collected, including contact info, health and fitness data, financial info, usage data, browsing history, location data, personal identifiers and search history. With this information available at a glance, a user can potentially make a more informed decision about whether they want to download a specific app on the iPhone or iPad or Mac, without falling down the data collection and privacy blackhole that became the norm over the years.A quick browse through the listings on the Apple App Store at this time makes for what is definitely a mixed bag when it comes to the compliance. Popular apps such as Truecaller have the complete list of data available as part of the privacy labels?data used to track you, data linked to you and data not linked to you. Shopping platform Flipkart and popular digital payments app PhonePe also have the privacy labels live on their app listings on the App Store. Popular payments platform and payments bankÿPaytmÿalso has the complete privacy labels available for users to check.ÿFacebookÿand the Facebook owned apps, including the Facebook app,ÿInstagram, Messenger,ÿWhatsAppÿand WhatsApp for Business are also disclosing the privacy details as part of the privacy labels on the App Store.ÿMicrosoftÿhas also updated the apps and the privacy details for their apps, including Microsoft Office, Microsoft Teams and the Microsoft Edge web browser.",0.241761469,"google 0.0406, data 0.0404, update 0.0379, apps 0.0257, privacy 0.0255, december 0.0230, store 0.0183, label 0.0182, list 0.0158, popular 0.0158"
Jan-21,"More than 400 Google engineers and other workers have formed a union, the group revealed on Monday, cappingÿyears of growing activismÿat one of the world?s largest companies and presenting a rare beachhead for labor organizers in staunchly anti-union Silicon Valley.The union?s creation is highly unusual for the tech industry, which has long resisted efforts to organize its largely white-collar work force. It follows increasing demands by employees at Google for policy overhauls on pay, harassment and ethics, and is likely to escalate tensions with top leadership.The new union, called theÿAlphabet Workers Unionÿafter Google?s parent company, Alphabet, was organized in secret for the better part of a year and elected its leadership last month. The group is affiliated with the Communications Workers of America, a union that represents workers in telecommunications and media in the United States and Canada.But unlike a traditional union, which demands that an employer come to the bargaining table to agree on a contract, the Alphabet Workers Union is a so-called minority union that represents a fraction of the company?s more thanÿ260,000 full-time employees and contractors. Workers said it was primarilyÿan effort to give structure and longevity to activism at Google, rather than to negotiate for a contract.Chewy Shaw, an engineer at Google in the San Francisco Bay Area and the vice chair of the union?s leadership council, said the union was a necessary tool to sustain pressure on management so that workers could force changes on workplace issues.?Our goals go beyond the workplace questions of ?Are people getting paid enough?? Our issues are going much broader,? he said. ?It is a time where a union is an answer to these problems.?In response, Kara Silverstein, Google?s director of people operations, said: ?We?ve always worked hard to create a supportive and rewarding workplace for our work force. Of course, our employees have protected labor rights that we support. But as we?ve always done, we?ll continue engaging directly with all our employees.?The new union is the clearest sign of how thoroughly employee activism has swept through Silicon Valley over the past few years. While software engineers and other tech workers largely kept quiet in the past on societal and political issues, employees atÿAmazon, Salesforce, Pinterest and others have become more vocal on matters like diversity, pay discrimination and sexual harassment.Image?Our goals go beyond the workplace questions of ?Are people getting paid enough??? Mr. Shaw said.Credit...Damien Maloney for The New York TimesImageNowhere have those voices been louder than at Google. In 2018, more than 20,000 employees staged a walkout to protest how the company handledÿsexual harassment. Others have opposed business decisions that they deemed unethical, such asÿdeveloping artificial intelligenceÿfor the Defense Department andÿproviding technologyÿto Customs and Border Protection.Even so, unions have not gained traction in Silicon Valley. Many tech workers shunned them, arguing that labor groups were focused on issues like wages ? not a top concern in the high-earning industry ? and were not equipped to address their concerns about ethics and the role of technology in society. Labor organizers also found it difficult to corral the tech companies? huge work forces, which are scattered around the globe.Only a few small union drives have succeeded in tech in the past. Workers at theÿcrowdfunding site Kickstarterÿand at the app development platformÿGlitchÿwon union campaigns last year, and a smallÿgroup of contractorsÿat a Google office in Pittsburgh unionized in 2019. Thousands of employees at anÿAmazon warehouse in Alabamaÿare also set to vote on a union in the coming months.?There are those who would want you to believe that organizing in the tech industry is completely impossible,? Sara Steffens, C.W.A.?s secretary-treasurer, said of the new Google union. ?If you don?t have unions in the tech industry, what does that mean for our country? That?s one reason, from C.W.A.?s point of view, that we see this as a priority.?Veena Dubal, a law professor at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law, said the Google union was a ?powerful experiment? because it brought unionization into a major tech company and skirted barriers that had prevented such organizing.?If it grows ? which Google will do everything they can to prevent ? it could have huge impacts not just for the workers but for the broader issues that we are all thinking about in terms of tech power in society,? she said.The union is likely to ratchet up tensions between Google engineers, who work on autonomous cars, artificial intelligence and internet search, and the company?s management. Sundar Pichai, Google?s chief executive, and other executives have tried to come to grips with an increasingly activist work force ? but have made missteps.Last month,ÿfederal officials saidÿGoogle had most likely wrongly fired two employees who protested its work with immigration authorities in 2019. Timnit Gebru, a Black woman who is aÿrespected artificial intelligence researcher,ÿalso said last month that Google had fired her after she criticized the company?s approach to minority hiring and the biases built into A.I. systems. Her departure set off a storm of criticism about Google?s treatment of minority employees.?These companies find it a bone in their throat to even have a small group of people who say, ?We work at Google and have another point of view,?? said Nelson Lichtenstein, the director of the Center for the Study of Work, Labor and Democracy at the University of California, Santa Barbara. ?Google might well succeed in decimating any organization that comes to the floor.?The Alphabet Workers Union, which represents employees in Silicon Valley and cities like Cambridge, Mass., and Seattle, gives protection and resources to workers who join. Those who opt to become members will contribute 1 percent of their total compensation to the union to fund its efforts.Over the past year, the C.W.A. has pushed to unionize white-collar tech workers. (The NewsGuild, a union that represents New York Times employees, is part of the C.W.A.) The drive focused initially on employees atÿvideo game companies, who often work grueling hours and face layoffs.In late 2019, C.W.A. organizers began meeting with Google employees to discuss a union drive, workers who attended the meetings said. Some employees were receptive and signed cards to officially join the union last summer. In December, the Alphabet Workers Union held elections to select a seven-person executive council.But several Google employees who had previously organized petitions and protests at the company objected to the C.W.A.?s overtures. They said they had declined to join because they worried that the effort had sidelined experienced organizers and played down the risks of organizing as it recruited members.ImageAmr Gaber, a Google software engineer who helped organizeÿthe 2018 walkout, said C.W.A. officials were dismissive of other labor groups that had supported Google workers during a December 2019 phone call with him and others.?They are more concerned about claiming turf than the needs of the workers who were on the phone call,? Mr. Gaber said. ?As a long-term labor organizer and brown man, that?s not the type of union I want to build.?The C.W.A. said it had been selected by Google workers to help organize the union and had not elbowed its way in. ?It?s really the workers who chose,? Ms. Steffens of C.W.A. said.Traditional unions typically enroll a majority of a work force and petition a state or federal labor board like the National Labor Relations Board to hold an election. If they win the vote, they can bargain with their employer on a contract. A minority union allows employees to organize without first winning a formal vote before the N.L.R.B.The C.W.A. has used this model to organize groups in states where it said labor laws were unfavorable, like the Texas State Employees Union and the United Campus Workers in Tennessee.The structure also gives the union the latitude to include Google contractors, whoÿoutnumber full-time workersÿand who would be excluded from a traditional union. Some Google employees have considered establishing a minority orÿsolidarity unionÿfor several years, and ride-hailing drivers have formed similar groups.Although they will not be able to negotiate a contract, the Alphabet Workers Union can use other tactics to pressure Google into changing its policies, labor experts said. Minority unions often turn to public pressure campaigns and lobby legislative or regulatory bodies to influence employers.?We?re going to use every tool that we can to use our collective action to protect people who we think are being discriminated against or retaliated against,? Mr. Shaw said.Members cited the recent N.L.R.B. finding on the firing of two employees and the exit of Dr. Gebru, the prominent researcher, as reasons to broaden its membership and publicly step up its efforts.?Google is making it all the more clear why we need this now,? said Auni Ahsan, a software engineer at Google and an at-large member of the union?s executive council. ?Sometimes the boss is the best organizer.?",0.067068429,"union 0.0332, google 0.0280, workers 0.0228, employees 0.0199, work 0.0117, labor 0.0116, company 0.0116, tech 0.0106, organize 0.0096"
Jan-21,"More than 200 Google employees in the United States have formed a workers? union, the first group at a big tech company to do so as the industry faces a reckoning over years of unchecked power.The elected leaders of the Alphabet Workers Union announced the organization in a New York Times opinion piece on Monday, saying they aimed to ensure employees work at a fair wage, without fear of abuse, retaliation or discrimination.The union is open to all US and Canadian workers at Google?s parent company, Alphabet, including full-time employees as well as temporary workers, vendors, and other contractors. These unofficial employees make up an enormous ?shadow? workforce at Google, outnumbering direct Google employees by around 135,000 to 115,000. In 2019, a small group of such contractors formed a union in Pittsburgh.?We?re building on years of organizing efforts at Google to create a formal structure for workers,? the union leaders wrote, adding that so far 226 employees had signed union cards with the Communications Workers of America.The group is forging a unique path to organizing ? it will not be seeking ratification through the US labor regulator the National Labor Relations Board, as is typical. Instead it will form a ?minority union?, which means it will not necessarily have legally protected rights to action like collective bargaining but will be able to include a wider range of workers, including contractors.Monday?s announcement comes after years of worker activism and internal protests. In 2018, workers staged a major walkout in Google campuses globally over the alleged mishandling of sexual harassment allegations. Also that year, Googlers wrote public letters denouncing the company?s role in building a censored search engine in China ? a project that was later abandoned.In 2019, Google employees wrote a public letter to the company calling on it to cut all its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Workers also signed a petition condemning a cloud computing contract Google had with US Customs and Border Protection over the agency?s role in separating immigrant families at the border. The treatment of temporary and contract workers at Google has also been a flashpoint for employees. Hundreds of employees signed a letter in solidarity with such workers in 2019.And in December 2020, workers demanded an apology from Google after Timnit Gebru, a prominent Black researcher in artificial intelligence, said she was fired after criticizing the company?s diversity efforts.Alex Gorowara, a member of the Alphabet union, said he had found himself disillusioned by the company?s departure from its former ethos in the five years he has worked there.?We have seen Google lose its ethics over time ? and at the same time, it has become more hostile to people trying to conduct themselves ethically,? he told the Guardian. ?We have seen retaliation, we have seen careers derailed ? this is in response to that.?In a statement, Google?s director of human resources, Kara Silverstein, said the company had ?always worked hard to create a supportive and rewarding workplace? for its employees.?Of course our employees have protected labor rights that we support,? she said. ?But as we?ve always done, we?ll continue engaging directly with all our employees.?Google has been under fire from the National Labor Relations Board, which has accused the company of unlawfully questioning several workers who were then terminated for protesting against company policies and trying to organize a union. Google has said it is confident it acted legally.The unionization effort is one of many challenges Google faces in the coming year. The company is battling three antitrust lawsuits that argue it has established a monopoly using unfair business practices, as lawmakers question aspects of its model including paying platforms to prioritize the Google search engine and its acquisition of competitors in the advertising space.Chewy Shaw, an engineer at Google in the San Francisco Bay Area and the vice-chair of the union?s leadership council, told the Times the union was needed to sustain pressure on management so that workers could force changes on workplace issues.?Our goals go beyond the workplace questions of ?Are people getting paid enough??

Jan-21,"Hundreds of employees at Google and its parent, Alphabetÿ(GOOGL), have launched a union, a rare step for the tech industry that also represents the biggest and most organized challenge yet to the company?s executive leadership.Announced Monday morning, the Alphabet Workers? Union will be run by employees and open both to full-time workers and contractors at the tech giant.?This is historic,? said Dylan Baker, a Google software engineer,ÿin a release. ?The first union at a major tech company by and for all tech workers. We will elect representatives, we will make decisions democratically, we will pay dues, and we will hire skilled organizers to ensure all workers at Google know they can work with us if they actually want to see their company reflect their values.?The initiative launched with more than 200 members, according to aÿNew York Times op-edÿthe group published Monday morning. As many as 226 of the group?s members have signed union cards with the Communications Workers of America (CWA), one of the country?s largest labor unions.The work to build the union began in secret over a year ago, said Andrew Gainer-Dewar, a Google software engineer who helped lead the effort.?You have to organize one-to-one, in sort of a very cloak-and-dagger way,? he told CNN Business, ?meeting with people, broaching the subject carefully, being really thoughtful about who we tell what, when, and really only reaching out based on their personal relationships, the people that we see being publicly upset about issues.?While the pandemic made it more challenging to hold those meetings face-to-face, he said, the shift to remote work, in some ways, made it easier to organize.?Video calls are a fantastic one-to-one mechanism,? Gainer-Dewar said. ?And the fact that we?re not having it in the office takes us out from under the all-seeing eye of a company like Google.?Unions can be federally certified when a majority of a workplace votes to support one in an election held by the National Labor Relations Board. Alternatively,ÿaccording to the NLRB, a union can be voluntarily recognized by an employer if enough workers indicate they would like the union to negotiate on their behalf.But the Google workers have opted for a third approach that, at least for now, does not anticipate formal recognition, said Beth Allen, communications director at CWA. That?s because traditional collective bargaining agreements ?almost always exclude contractors,? Allen said, which was a nonstarter for many of the Google organizers.That doesn?t rule out the union seeking formal recognition later on. But until then, union members won?t enjoy the backstop of a collective bargaining agreement with Google. Instead, Allen said, the union will likely need to pursue other tactics to push for changes at Google, such as pushing for outside media coverage, pressuring Congress for new legislation and oversight, or filing complaints to the NLRB.Google workers could also theoretically mount a strike, though that would be a challenge and there are no current plans to do so, Allen said.In response to the union effort, Google pledged to engage with workers.?We?ve always worked hard to create a supportive and rewarding workplace for our workforce,? said Kara Silverstein, Google?s director of people operations, in a statement to CNN Business. ?Of course our employees have protected labor rights that we support. But as we?ve always done, we?ll continue engaging directly with all our employees.?The union?s formation comes after years ofÿrising employee tensionsÿat Google over the company?s business and operational decisions, including its work with the defense sector, plans for a censored search engine in China, and the company?s handling of sexual misconduct claims, the last of which resulted in aÿmassive employee protest. The union?s demands hit on many of those issues.?For far too long, thousands of us at Google ? and other subsidiaries of Alphabet, Google?s parent company ? have had our workplace concerns dismissed by executives,? the workers wrote in the Times op-ed. ?Our bosses have collaborated with repressive governments around the world. They have developed artificial intelligence technology for use by the Department of Defense and profited from ads by a hate group. They have failed to make the changes necessary to meaningfully address our retention issues with people of color.?The organizers made special mention of Timnit Gebru, a top AI researcher who recently departed from Google after she criticized the company?s diversity efforts ? sparking an outcry over Google?s workplace practices.Some workers who have raised their voices in the past have been terminated, in certain cases leading to complaints to the NLRB.

Jan-21,"Google has announced a plan to tackle privacy issues in online advertising, as the company attempts to chart a middle ground between Apple?s privacy-first approach and the needs of advertisers ? including itself.Google will use AI to bundle an individual user with similar visitors in an attempt to convince users that they don?t need to block all tracking on the internet to preserve their privacy. It will also use a ?trusted server? to store adverts without needing to connect to hundreds of providers across the wider web, and cryptography to ensure that advertisers only find out the information they need to pay websites.?We believe that the notion that ?it?s privacy or it?s advertising? is a false choice,? said Chetna Bindra, Google?s head of user trust and privacy for advertising. ?We really do believe there is a way to meet user expectations, and protect their identity, while allowing for ad supported content.?Google says it will shortly begin to experiment in Chrome, its browser, with how to actually do that. A new ?privacy sandbox? bundles together five proposals with bird-themed code-names including Floc (federated learning of cohorts), Fledge (first ?locally-executed decision over groups? experiment) and turtledove (two uncorrelated requests, then locally-executed decision on victory), which explore various ways with letting advertisers continue to target ads on the internet, but without the vast surveillance ecosystem that exists to support that.It?s an approach that differs from the simpler option selected by Apple for Safari: just block all the surveillance. Bindra said there are multiple reasons why the company went a different route.One is that Google has a more rosy view than its competitor of the importance of advertising. ?We do believe that ads play a major role in making the internet an accessible and open place,? she said, specifically siting the need for marketers ?to connect with people interested in what they have to offer?.But that optimism is paired with a pessimistic view of what blocking surveillance actually means: an arms race between the blockers and the blocked. ?A large focus of this effort has been to ensure the ad industry is not being driven towards workarounds for their business where they?re actually circumventing true user privacy,? Bindra said. ?We?ve certainly seen that happen over the last couple of years, where companies have leaned into things like fingerprinting and other alternative techniques to be able to work around the absence of third party cookies in certain browsers.?But whatever Google does to online advertising, the company walks a tightrope. With Chrome?s share of the browser market and Google?s share of the online advertising market, it has to keep one eye on the Competition and Markets Authority, which has already announced plans to try to limit Google?s power.

Jan-21,"Google has suspended ""free speech"" social network Parler from its Play Store over its failure to remove ""egregious content"".Parler styles itself as ""unbiased"" social media and has proved popular with people banned from Twitter.But Google said the app had failed to remove posts inciting violence.Apple has also warned Parler it will remove the app from its App Store if it does not comply with its content-moderation requirements.On Parler, the app's chief executive John Matze said: ""We won't cave to politically motivated companies and those authoritarians who hate free speech!""Launched in 2018, Parler has proved particularly popular among supporters of US President Donald Trump and right-wing conservatives. Such groups have frequently accused Twitter and Facebook of unfairly censoring their views.While Mr Trump himself is not a user, the platform already features several high-profile contributors following earlier bursts of growth in 2020.Texas Senator Ted Cruz boasts 4.9 million followers on the platform, while Fox News host Sean Hannity has about seven million.It briefly became the most-downloaded app in the United States after the US election, following a clampdown on the spread of election misinformation by Twitter and Facebook.However, both Apple and Google have said the app fails to comply with content-moderation requirements. Analysis: Necessary or draconian action?By Shayan Sardarizadeh, BBC MonitoringFor months, Parler has been one of the most popular social media platforms for right-wing users.As major platforms began taking action against viral conspiracy theories, disinformation and the harassment of election workers and officials in the aftermath of the US presidential vote, the app became more popular with elements of the fringe far-right.This turned the network into a right-wing echo chamber, almost entirely populated by users fixated on revealing examples of election fraud and posting messages in support of attempts to overturn the election outcome.In the days preceding the Capitol riots, the tone of discussion on the app became significantly more violent, with some users openly discussing ways to stop the certification of Joe Biden's victory by Congress.Unsubstantiated allegations and defamatory claims against a number of senior US figures such as Chief Justice John Roberts and Vice-President Mike Pence were rife on the app.Google and Apple say they are taking necessary action to ensure violent rhetoric is not promoted on their platforms.However, to those increasingly concerned about freedom of speech and expression on online platforms, it represents another example of draconian action by major tech companies which threatens internet freedom.This is a debate which is certain to continue beyond the Trump presidency. In a statement, Google confirmed it had suspended Parler from its Play Store, saying: ""Our longstanding policies require that apps displaying user-generated content have moderation policies and enforcement that removes egregious content like posts that incite violence.""In light of this ongoing and urgent public safety threat, we are suspending the app's listings from the Play Store until it addresses these issues.""Apple has warned Parler it will be removed from the App Store on Saturday in a letter published by Buzzfeed News.It said it had seen ""accusations that the Parler app was used to plan, coordinate, and facilitate"" the attacks on the US Capitol on 6 January.Mr Matze said Parler had ""no way to organise anything"" and pointed out that Facebook groups and events had been used to organise action.But Apple said: ""Our investigation has found that Parler is not effectively moderating and removing content that encourages illegal activity and poses a serious risk to the health and safety of users in direct violation of your own terms of service.""""We won't distribute apps that present dangerous and harmful content.""In a related development, Google has kicked Steve Bannon's War Room podcast off YouTube, saying it had repeatedly violated the platform's rules.The ex-White House aide's channel had more than 300,000 subscribers.""In accordance with our strikes system, we have terminated Steve Bannon's channel 'War room' and one associated channel for repeatedly violating our Community Guidelines,"" Google said in a statement.""Any channel posting new videos with misleading content that alleges widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of the 2020 US Presidential election in violation of our policies will receive a strike, a penalty which temporarily restricts uploading or live-streaming. Channels that receive three strikes in the same 90-day period will be permanently removed from YouTube.""The action was taken shortly after the channel posted an interview with Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, in which he blamed the Democrats for the rioting on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.One anti-misinformation group said the action was long overdue after ""months of Steve Bannon calling for revolution and violence"".""The truth is YouTube should have taken down Steve Bannon's account a long time ago and they shouldn't rely on the labour of extremism researchers to moderate the content on their platform,"" said Madeline Peltz, Senior Researcher at Media Matters for America.",0.029501563,"parler 0.0197, content 0.0162, google 0.0128, remove 0.0128, action 0.0127, channel 0.0110, election 0.0110, apple 0.0093, store 0.0093"

And I was texting friends who had been involved with organizing and they were like, 'Oh, this is my experience with HR. This is what has happened. Don't forget to take notes on it,'"" said Muthukumar, 25, who is based in New York City.She says she was told that a colleague was offended by her email. One of the pages she referred to did indeed contain harsh language to describe police. Still, she never expected the matter to land on the radar of higher ups.""It just seemed like such a neutral thing, sending a little GoFundMe list,"" Muthukumar said. ""And that got me in trouble.""From a stern talking-to from HR to being demoted or forced out after speaking out, stories about bristling tensions between Google workers and executives have consumed the tech giant in recent months.And it was against this backdrop that Muthukumar and several hundred of her colleagues did something this week rarely seen in Silicon Valley: theyÿformedÿa labor union.Called the Alphabet Workers Union, after Google's parent company, it now represents more than 600 Google employees and contractors with the support of the CommunicationsÿWorkers of America.Unlike traditional unions, this group is a so-called ""minority union"" and does not have the power to force the company to collectively bargain over pay and benefits. But organizers say that is not the point. This movement, they say, is to examine Google's role in society and help reshape the company's culture.""The fear of retaliation has always been great and we've seen retaliation, so this is our chance to protect ourselves,"" Muthukumar said.Already, the union is exerting its influence. After Facebookÿannouncedÿit would indefinitely ban Trump, and Twitterÿtemporarilyÿsuspended the president's account for several hours, the Google union lambasted their bosses for not doing enough.Google-owned YouTube did remove a video address in which Trump circulates election falsehoods and glorifies the violent rioters who swarmed the Capitol.The actions were ""lackluster,"" the Googleÿunion wrote.""We warned our executives about this danger, only to be ignored or given token concessions,"" the union said. ""YouTube will continue to function as a vector for the growth of fascist movements if it persists in prioritizing advertisers while exposing the public.""Challenging the 'massive power' of Google executivesFor the past year, organizers say, workers at Google have been quietly plotting a way to organize the company, with plans of launching later this year.But the union sped up its timeline after theÿabrupt firingÿin December of prominent Black researcher Timnit Gebru, who co-led a team examining the ethics of artificial intelligence technologies. Gebru was also a vocal critic of the company's diversity efforts, and the first Black woman to be a research scientist at Google.More than 2,600 of Gebru's former colleaguesÿsignedÿa public letter denouncing Google's ouster of Gebru ? which the company insists was a resignation. The incident reignited worker fury against top executives, underscoring the need for a way to speak out without the fear of reprisal, according to union organizers.""There is massive power that has been concentrated at the executive level,"" said Alan Morales, a Google engineer who is now a member of the union. ""As a tech employee, it's a reasonable ask to ensure that this labor is being used for something positive that makes the world a better place.""The union is a symptom of a larger shift at Google, where theÿmedian payÿis around $200,000. For years, employees were reluctant to publicly criticize the company.That began to change in 2018, when 20,000 Google workers around the worldÿstaged a walkoutÿto protest how the company handled sexual harassment claims. Others more recently have openlyÿquestionedÿsome of Google's work, like selling technology to U.S. border agents and the military. And accounts of how women and people of color receive different treatment at the company have circulated widely since Gebru's firing.All of this, says Chris Benner, professor at the University of California Santa Cruz, helped build the momentum for Google's union.""It shows that broader concerns about growing income and wealth inequality in our society, and unfair labor practices, are now being shared by some of the most well-paid employees in the tech industry,"" said Benner, who has long studied the tech sector. ""I would not be surprised if we saw more of this in Silicon Valley in the coming year.""Former Google executive: Union could damage company's imageGoogle officials declined to be interviewed about the union.But Kara Silverstein, the director of Google's People Operations, said in a statement that the company has always ""worked hard to create a supportive and rewarding workplace"" and that it will ""continue engaging directly with all our employees.""That statement ""struck me as an example that they really don't get it,"" Ross LaJeunesse, a former Google executive, told NPR.Until 2019, LaJeunesse was the global head of the company's international relations. He says he was forced out of Googleÿfor raising objectionsÿabout working with the governments of China and Saudi Arabia, saying such business ventures would make the company ""complicit in human rights violations.""Google disputes his firing was retaliatory, claiming LaJeunesse lost his job due to company reorganization.LaJeunesse says he believes upper management is likely worried the new union will damage Google's image at a time when public opinion is turning against Big Tech.""First thing that Google executives will be concerned about is potential damage to the brand and the PR efforts the company constantly undertakes,"" he said.LaJeunesse said the union's creation is proof that company executives have failed to engage directly with growing calls for reform from some of the company's rank and file, and that the distrust sowed between employees and management could hurt the company in the long term.""Really, this should be an alarm to investors and to the Board,"" LaJeunesse said.

Jan-21,"Last week, Google proposed something quite extraordinary: pulling its search service from Australia if Canberra passed new legislation targeting internet giants. Google Australia managing director Mel Silva argued the bill ? which would force tech giants to pay for news they linked to ? would create ""unmanageable financial and operational risk"" to its business.The proposed law ? the News Media Bargaining Code ? would also order Google to establish commercial agreements with every news outlet, otherwise the search engine could face forced arbitration.It's not the first time Google has found itself in a situation like this.In 2010, Google and other tech companies were the subject of a ""highly sophisticated and targeted"" cyber attack originating in China and reportedly backed by Beijing.The attack prompted Google to stop complying with Chinese censorship demands, which saw its service soon shut down.And now most of China's more than 900 million netizens, who account for nearly 20 per cent of active internet users around the world, can't easily access the search engine.But the standoff with Beijing over censorship does help inform how Australians might be affected if the company terminates its service here.Google.cn was launched in China in 2006.But after the cyber attack in 2010, Google decided to redirect traffic to Google.com.hk in Hong Kong, where the censorship rules didn't apply.It meant Chinese netizens were temporarily able to access uncensored search results, including articles about the Tiananmen Square massacre, before Beijing cracked down and the service became inaccessible.Google's departure allowed its Chinese competitor Baidu to soon capture three-quarters of China's search market.Baidu faced its own issues though, particularly over its pay-for-placement results and one incident in which a student died after getting experimental cancer treatment from a hospital that appeared at the top of a Baidu search.Expats and Chinese netizens who still wanted access to Google's uncensored results have been turning to technology such as virtual private networks (VPNs) and proxies.However, authorities have in recent years been increasingly punishing people using unauthorised VPNs.Google tried to reignite its presence in China with a project called Dragonfly, but the controversial search engine was also terminated after being criticised for its attempt to provide censored content.Dr Min Jiang, professor of communication studies at the University of North Carolina, told the ABC that although Google pulled its search services, the company still actually existed in China courtesy of an AI research centre it opened in Beijing in 2017.But she said the shutdown of Google search, which at one point had 30 per cent of the market in China, had been ""a boon"" to other Chinese tech companies, including Baidu.""Even after Google left mainland China, the rise of other search engine companies like Sogou, for instance, can keep Baidu on its toes,"" Dr Jiang told the ABC.""After 2016, when we learned about Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal, the US tech giants ? have been viewed worldwide, including in China, with increasing suspicion.""It's really hard to say if Google would be embraced, if Google decided to open its service again in China.""Are there any lessons for Australians?Google has about a 90-95 per cent share of the search engine market in Australia.Similarly to the Chinese example, if Google was to quit Australia other alternatives would still remain such as Microsoft's Bing, Yahoo and privacy-focused site DuckDuckGo.But how much users might turn to these providers is not clear.In 2016, Chinese writer and photographer Yang Fei published an investigative report, which has received million of views, helping to explain to younger generations why Google was not accessible in China.He told the ABC that he was keeping a close eye on Google's standoff with Canberra, and suggested that Australians should be prepared for different scenarios.Living in China's southern Hunan province, Mr Yang has been using a VPN to access Google since 2010.He said Google could redirect the Australian search page to an equivalent version in another country.But the practice would likely have a major impact on localised search results that thousands of Australian businesses rely on.If Google was to block Australian users based on their geographic location, Mr Yang said Australians would still be able to use VPNs, which some tech-savvy people already use to stream geo-blocked content.""Australians have no need to worry about it, because there are always solutions in the future,"" Mr Yang said.""To be honest ? the case between the Australian Government and Google has been a great example to reflect on the monopoly in technology.""Dr Jiang stressed it was important to remember that Google's ""first and foremost concern is not democratisation"", but its own bottom line.""I think most people would recognise how naive it was to assume Western technology somehow would bring openness and democracy to an authoritarian society,"" Dr Jiang said.""It hasn't really worked out in China, nor has it worked out even in the United States.""",0.116894754,"google 0.0465, china 0.0233, search 0.0232, would 0.0164, chinese 0.0129, service 0.0111, baidu 0.0094, australians 0.0094, engine 0.0094, company 0.0093"
Jan-21," Search and advertising giant Google closed its deal to buy fitness tracking company Fitbit (FIT.N), the companies said on Thursday, even as U.S. and Australian competition regulators said they were continuing probes of the $2.1 billion transaction.The Justice Department, which sued Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google in October for allegedly violating antitrust law in its search and search advertising businesses, said it ""has not reached a final decision about whether to pursue an enforcement action"" regarding the Fitbit deal.The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Chair Rod Sims said ""depending on the results of our investigation, we will consider whether to take legal action on this matter.""Google said it ""complied with the DOJ's (Justice Department's) extensive review for the past 14 months, and the agreed upon waiting period expired without their objection.""""We continue to be in touch with them and we?re committed to answering any additional questions,"" the company added.Google did not immediately respond to Sims' statement.It is rare for a big deal to close without antitrust approval.Google won EU antitrust approval last month for its Fitbit bid after agreeing to restrictions on how it will use customers' health-related data.Australia rejected similar restrictions proposed by Google, expressing concern that the company might block Fitbit rivals from connecting to phones running Google's Android operating software. read moreFitbit makes a watch-like device to measure physical activity that competes with Apple Watch and others.

Jan-21,"EU antitrust regulators have sought information from advertisers regarding Google?s advertising technology practices, a European Commission document seen by Reuters shows. Alphabet-owned Google, the world?s largest online search engine, has been hit with fines totalling 8.25 billion euros ($10 billion) in the last three years for blocking rivals in online shopping, Android smartphones and online advertising.It now faces two European Union investigations into its advertising practices, focused on technology and data.Google and Facebook together capture over half of the internet ad sales market globally. Both companies are currently the target of a U.S. lawsuit over their 2018 deal which gives Facebook?s advertiser clients the option to place ads within Google?s network of publishing partnersGoogle said it was cooperating with the Commission, whose 13-page questionnaire sent to advertisers this month asked about the impact of using the default setting ?Include Google Display Network? introduced in 2018 for search campaigns on Google Ads.?We compete with many others in the industry and give people granular controls over how their information is used to personalize ads and limit the sharing of personal data to safeguard people?s privacy,? a Google spokeswoman said.The Commission said the questionnaires are part of its investigation into Google?s data usage.?This investigation covers all services of Google, including digital advertising and the ad tech chain,? the EU competition enforcer said on Wednesday.The EU also wants to know if advertisers receive rebates when they use Google intermediaries which allow advertisers or media agencies to buy advertising inventory from many sources.The questionnaire also asks whether the ability to access Google?s YouTube is tied to the selection of an intermediary.It asked if Google?s integration in 2018 of its online ad delivery unit DoubleClick impacted advertisers as well as any imminent impact from its plan to phase out third-party cookies on the Chrome browser by the end of 2022.Advertisers have until Friday to reply to the questionnaire, which was first reported on by Politico.",0.106944444,"google 0.0514, advertisers 0.0266, advertise 0.0224, online 0.0183, commission 0.0140, data 0.0140, ask 0.0140, questionnaire 0.0139, impact 0.0139"
Jan-21,"Google has been hiding some Australian news sites from search results, in a move media outlets say is a show of ?extraordinary power? as the tech company bargains with the Australian government over financial payment for content.The Australian government is attempting to impose a new code on Google and Facebook that would force them to negotiate a fair price for displaying local news content.Google has criticised the proposed code ? which would be a world first ? in messages to the search engine?s users while Facebook has warned it could block Australians from sharing local news as a consequence.The Australian Financial Review on Wednesday reported that Google had tweaked its search and news algorithm to bury links to some commercial Australian media outlets for some users.A Google spokesperson confirmed the company was ?running a few experiments that will each reach about 1% of Google Search users in Australia to measure the impacts of news businesses and Google Search on each other?. The experiments would finish by early February, he told Guardian Australia.Google sought to downplay the significance of the move by noting the company conducted ?tens of thousands of experiments in Google Search? every year.?In 2018, the value we provided to publishers through referral traffic alone was estimated at $218m,? the spokesperson said.?We remain committed to getting to a workable code and look forward to working with the Senate committee, policymakers and publishers to achieve an outcome that?s fair for everyone, in the interests of all Australians.?Anecdotal evidence from Guardian Australia readers appeared to confirm that when logged into a Google account, the Guardian Australia website did not appear in search results, which instead returned the Guardian?s Twitter, Facebook and Wikipedia pages.Nine, the publisher of the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age and the AFR, said the result of searches delivered to some Google users ?makes it starkly clear that trusted local news is critical to Google?s products?.?Google is an effective monopoly and by withholding access to such timely, accurate and important information they show clearly how they impact what access Australians have to that,? a spokesperson said.?At the same time, Google are now demonstrating how easily they can make Australian news providers who fall out of their favour effectively disappear from the internet ? a chilling illustration of their extraordinary market power.?On Tuesday, Mel Silva, the vice-president for Google Australia and New Zealand, claimed that the ?overwhelming majority? of submitters to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission?s consultations had ?concerns about key aspects of the code or are downright opposed to it?.Silva said that Google had accepted arbitration as a ?reasonable backstop? to secure investment in news. But the search giant has warned the ACCC?s model is flawed because it considers only news companies? costs and not Google?s ? and encourages ?ambit claims?.Google has also rejected fundamental elements of the code as unworkable, including that it ?forces Google to pay to show links in an unprecedented intervention that would fundamentally break how search engines work?, and that it would give news companies ?special treatment? in the form of 14 days? notice of certain changes to algorithms.",0.148203463,"google 0.0535, search 0.0287, news 0.0287, australian 0.0203, would 0.0148, code 0.0147, company 0.0147, australia 0.0147, guardian 0.0120"
Jan-21,"Google?s parent company Alphabet is shutting down Loon, a high-profile subsidiary spun out from its research labs that used high-altitude helium balloons to deliver cellular connectivity from the stratosphere.Nearly a decade after it began the project, Alphabet said on Thursday that it pulled the plug on Loon because it did not see a way to reduce costs to create a sustainable business. Along with the self-driving car unit Waymo, Loon was one of the most hyped ?moonshot? technology projects to emerge from Alphabet?s research lab, X.?The road to commercial viability has proven much longer and riskier than hoped. So we?ve made the difficult decision to close down Loon,? Astro Teller, who heads X, wrote in a blog post. Alphabet said it expected to wind down operations in ?the coming months? with the hope of finding other positions for Loon employees at Alphabet.The idea behind Loon was to bring cellular connectivity to remote parts of the world where building a traditional mobile network would be too difficult and too costly. Alphabet promoted the technology as a potentially promising way to bring internet connectivity to not just the ?next billion? consumers but the ?last billion.?The giant helium balloons, made from sheets of polyethylene, are the size of tennis courts. They were powered by solar panels and navigated by flight control software that used artificial intelligence to drift efficiently in the stratosphere. While up in the air, they act as ?floating cell towers,? transmitting internet signals to ground stations and personal devices.Google started working on Loon in 2011 and launched the project with a public test in 2013. Loon became a stand-alone subsidiary in 2018, a few years after Google became a holding company called Alphabet. In April 2019, it accepted a $125 million investment from a SoftBank unit called HAPSMobile to advance the use of ?high-altitude vehicles? to deliver internet connectivity.Last year, it announced the first commercial deployment of the technology with Telkom Kenya to provide a 4G LTE network connection to a nearly 31,000-square-mile area across central and western Kenya, including the capital, Nairobi. Before then, the balloons had been used only in emergency situations, such as after Hurricane Maria knocked out Puerto Rico?s cellular network.However, Loon was starting to run out of money and had turned to Alphabet to keep its business solvent while it sought another investor in the project, according to a November report in The Information.The decision to shut down Loon is another signal of Alphabet?s recent austerity toward its ambitious and costly technology projects. Under Ruth Porat, Alphabet?s chief financial officer since 2015, the company has kept a close watch over the finances of its so-called Other Bets, fledgling business ventures aimed at diversifying from its core advertising business.Alphabet has aggressively pushed its ?Other Bets? like Waymo and Verily, a life sciences unit, to accept outside investors and branch out on their own. Projects that failed to secure outside investment or show enough financial promise have been discarded, such as Makani, a project to produce wind energy kites that Alphabet shut down last year.That austerity has been a notable change from a time when units like X, which had been a favored vanity project of Google?s co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, had autonomy to spend freely to pursue ambitious technology projects even if the financial outlook remained unclear.",0.007944444,"alphabet 0.0309, loon 0.0257, project 0.0233, technology 0.0132, business 0.0108, google 0.0108, connectivity 0.0108, high 0.0084, last 0.0084, balloon 0.0083"

Nov-21,"Google’s attempt to challenge a $2.8 billion antitrust fine for favoring its own shopping services in search results was rejected by Europe’s second-highest court providing a boost for the European Union’s competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager’s Big Tech antitrust campaign. The ruling from the EU’s General Court confirmed that Google’s parent company Alphabet had broken antitrust rules by favoring its own in-house price comparison tools over smaller European rivals, and upheld the $2.8 billion fine. However the Luxembourg court rejected regulators' claim that Google had distorted competition among search engines. ""The General Court largely dismisses Google's action against the decision of the Commission finding that Google abused its dominant position by favouring its own comparison shopping service over competing comparison shopping services,"" the Court said in a statement. Google can still appeal the ruling to the European Court of Justice. Europe’s Competition WatchdogThe European Commission, the EU’s top antitrust enforcer, under Margrethe Vestager has repeatedly tried to check Alphabet, and the dominance of other Silicon Valley giants in recent years. Google is currently fighting in the EU courts a $5 billion fine, the largest ever antitrust penalty from Brussels, levied in 2018 for its control over the Android operating system, and a $1.7 billion fine in 2019 for allegedly engaging in “illegal practices” to maintain its lead in online advertising. Today’s ruling provides a boost for Vestager’s campaign after the European Commission lost a court case in July 2020 over whether the Irish government broke state aid rules by awarding Apple $15 billion in tax breaks. The case has been appealed to the EU’s highest court but it could take years for a final ruling to emerge.That setback came shortly after Vestager’s antitrust unit opened an investigation in June into whether Google favored its own online advertising technology like Google Ad Manager on YouTube to squeeze out European rivals, and publishers. This investigation would cut to the heart of Google’s business in display advertising but the potential penalties that can be levied by the EU are dwarfed by the scale of Alphabet’s recent record-breaking profits but a new law could strengthen Vestager’s hand.The Digital Markets Act was unveiled in December 2020 and faces a long journey to approval by the EU’s lawmakers but would class companies like Alphabet as “gatekeepers” and could potentially force them to sell off units, or bind them not to rank internal products like Chrome over rivals. Today’s ruling will also provide a boost to Google’s European price comparison rivals like Kelkoo who have filed multi-billion dollar damages lawsuits off the back of the European Commission finding.A Gathering Storm Alphabet, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft don’t only face challenges from Brussels. A growing international pushback on the dominance of Big Tech from lawmakers and antitrust regulators threatens further scrutiny at every step. Australia’s antitrust regulator has called for laws to break Google’s lock over the local display advertising market while the U.K’s increasingly activist Competition And Markets Authority has opened a probe into changes to Alphabet’s Chrome browser.Across the Atlantic, Alphabet faces a trio of major antitrust lawsuits in the United States. The Department of Justice was joined by 11 Republican state attorney generals in June 2020 to sue Google over its tactics to remain the de facto search engine on many devices and browsers, while in December a coalition of 38 states sued Google over claims it designed search results to favor its own services, while a third lawsuit also filed in December claims Google and Facebook worked together on advertising sales.A Minor VictoryGoogle does however have some cause to celebrate after the U.K.’s Supreme Court earlier on Wednesday blocked a class action lawsuit that was seeking $4.3 billion in damage over claims that it had illegally tracked the personal data of around 4 million Apple iPhone users. The ruling represents a setback for similar cases against tech giants like TikTok and Facebook over data handling that are working through Britain’s courts.",0.09577269,"google 0.0325, court 0.0239, antitrust 0.0197, rule 0.0176, european 0.0174, alphabet 0.0154, billion 0.0154, break 0.0113, advertise 0.0112, like 0.0112"
Nov-21,"Google has lost its appeal against a €2.42bn EU competition fine over its Shopping service, in a ruling that is likely to re-energise antitrust investigators looking at how Big Tech promotes its own businesses.The European General Court in Luxembourg ruled on Wednesday that Google favours “its own comparison shopping service over competing services” in its search results, rather than delivering the “better result”.Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s antitrust chief, accused Google in 2017, after a seven-year investigation, of abusing its market power to give an “illegal advantage” to another arm of its business. Some price comparison websites have gone bust since Google engaged in this behaviour.Shivaun Raff, co-founder of Foundem, a now defunct shopping comparison website that was an original plaintiff in the EU’s investigation, said: “While we welcome today’s judgment, it does not undo the considerable consumer and anti-competitive harm caused by more than a decade of Google’s insidious search manipulation practices.”Google said the judgment on Wednesday related to a “very specific set of facts” and that it made changes in 2017 to comply with the European Commission’s decision.The ruling is likely to be appealed. But it marks the first time that a European court has ruled against Google on an antitrust case.It also strengthens the hands of antitrust investigators looking to take on similar cases where tech companies have used their dominance in one field to successfully move into another. The practice is known as “self-preferencing”.“The rules gives new and immediate vigour to straightforward enforcement of existing competition rules without the need to await the new legislation being adopted and coming into force,” said Alec Burnside, a partner at Dechert in Brussels who has worked with complainants against Google.He added: “The ruling infuses more oxygen to Vestager’s move to tackle big tech. The commission took the Shopping case decision to establish a precedent and that has now been validated.”Nevertheless Raff said the EU was moving too slowly to rein in Big Tech, saying that in the 12 years since Foundem submitted its initial competition complaint, Google has not yet been forced to “end or mitigate its unlawful conduct.”Richard Stables, chief executive of comparison shopping site Kelkoo, said it had lost “millions of euros of revenue during this abuse and we are not seeing a fraction of that coming back”.The European Commission said that it would “continue to use all the tools at its disposal” to try to address problems in the market.Google is also contesting another two multibillion euro fines for alleged anti-competitive behaviour. It has been accused of abusing its dominance in the Android operating system and allegedly forcing users to use its services over rivals, and is also appealing a €1.5bn fine for blocking competitors in the online advertising market.The cases come as the European Parliament and member states are debating how to enact new tech regulation to hold Big Tech to account.Andreas Schwab, the MEP leading the debate on the Digital Markets Act at the European Parliament, said: “The decision of the court proves that the EU is on the right track.“Unfortunately we have lost a lot of time for imposing our rules on the gatekeepers. This will change soon with the DMA.

Nov-21,"A top European Union court on Wednesday rejected Google’s appeal of a 2.4 billion euro ($2.8 billion) fine from regulators who found the tech giant abused its massive online reach by giving its own shopping recommendations an illegal advantage in search results.The European Commission, the 27-nation bloc’s top competition watchdog, punished Google in 2017 for unfairly directing visitors to its own shopping service, Google Shopping, to the detriment of competitors. The EU’s General Court dismissed Google’s appeal of that antitrust penalty and upheld the fine.“The General Court thus rules that, in reality, Google favors its own comparison shopping service over competing services, rather than a better result over another result,” it said in a press release.Google said it made changes in 2017 to comply with the European Commission’s decision.“Our approach has worked successfully for more than three years, generating billions of clicks for more than 700 comparison shopping services,” a Google statement said.The fine was part of an effort by European regulators to curb the online giant’s clout on the continent. It was followed by two other blockbuster antitrust penalties against Google, totaling 8.25 billion euros ($9.5 billion), which the company also is appealing. The fines are a drop in the bucket for Google’s parent company, Alphabet Inc., which earned $182 billion in revenue last year.The penalties were early salvos in the EU’s crackdown on tech companies, which has expanded to include other Silicon Valley digital giants. The commission this year launched fresh antitrust investigations into whether Google and Facebook are stifling competition in digital and classified advertising markets. It’s also investigating Apple over payments and Amazon over concerns it’s unfairly competing against independent merchants on its platform with its own products.Meanwhile, the EU also is drafting new digital rules to rein in online services by making them more accountable for illegal goods and harmful content found on their platforms, with the threat of fines worth up to 10% of global annual revenue.Wednesday’s ruling can still be appealed to the European Court of Justice, the bloc’s highest court, but only on points of law, not the facts. Google hasn’t decided whether to do so, saying it will closely review the decision.The case began after the European Commission received a complaint in 2009. It dragged on as fruitless attempts to negotiate a settlement delayed the final decision, drawing criticism that the commission wasn’t acting fast enough to stop Google from cornering online markets.That’s something the European Commission is trying to address with its new digital rules, which aim to prevent bad behavior, rather than punishing past actions as it has previously done. It also has started using “interim measures” as a speedy way to halt anticompetitive behavior while investigations are carried out.The commission welcomed the court’s new ruling.“The judgment today delivers a clear message that Google’s conduct was unlawful and it provides the necessary legal clarity for the market,” spokesperson Arianna Podesta said in a press briefing in Brussels.",0.10245559,"google 0.0384, commission 0.0213, european 0.0211, court 0.0182, shop 0.0154, billion 0.0153, service 0.0153, rule 0.0153, appeal 0.0126"
Nov-21,"Three years after an employee revolt forced Google to abandon work on a Pentagon program that used artificial intelligence, the company is aggressively pursuing a major contract to provide its technology to the military.The company’s plan to land the potentially lucrative contract, known as the Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability, could raise a furor among its outspoken work force and test the resolve of management to resist employee demands.In 2018, thousands of Google employees signed a letter protesting the company’s involvement in Project Maven, a military program that uses artificial intelligence to interpret video images and could be used to refine the targeting of drone strikes. Google management caved and agreed to not renew the contract once it expired.The outcry led Google to create guidelines for the ethical use of artificial intelligence, which prohibit the use of its technology for weapons or surveillance, and hastened a shake-up of its cloud computing business. Now, as Google positions cloud computing as a key part of its future, the bid for the new Pentagon contract could test the boundaries of those A.I. principles, which have set it apart from other tech giants that routinely seek military and intelligence work.The military’s initiative, which aims to modernize the Pentagon’s cloud technology and support the use of artificial intelligence to gain an advantage on the battlefield, is a replacement for a contract with Microsoft that was canceled this summer amid a lengthy legal battle with Amazon. Google did not compete against Microsoft for that contract after the uproar over Project Maven.The Pentagon’s restart of its cloud computing project has given Google a chance to jump back into the bidding, and the company has raced to prepare a proposal to present to Defense officials, according to four people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. In September, Google’s cloud unit made it a priority, declaring an emergency “Code Yellow,” an internal designation of importance that allowed the company to pull engineers off other assignments and focus them on the military project, two of those people said.On Tuesday, the Google cloud unit’s chief executive, Thomas Kurian, met with Charles Q. Brown, Jr., the chief of staff of the Air Force, and other top Pentagon officials to make the case for his company, two people said.Google, in a written statement, said it is “firmly committed to serving our public sector customers” including the Defense Department, and that it “will evaluate any future bid opportunities accordingly.”The contract replaces the now-scrapped Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, the Pentagon cloud computing contract that was estimated to be worth $10 billion over 10 years. The exact size of the new contract is unknown, although it is half the duration and will be awarded to more than one company, not to a single provider like JEDI.It is unclear whether the work, which would provide the Defense Department access to Google’s cloud products, would violate Google’s A.I. principles, although the Defense Department has said the technology is expected to support the military in combat. But Pentagon rules about outside access to sensitive or classified data could prevent Google from seeing exactly how its technology is being used.The Defense Department said it would seek proposals from a limited set of companies that could meet its requirements. “As this is an active acquisition, we cannot provide any additional information related to this effort,” said Russell Goemaere, a spokesman for the department.After a late start in selling its cloud computing technology to other organizations, Google has struggled to close the gap with Amazon and Microsoft, which have the two biggest cloud computing businesses. To bring in more big customers, Google hired Mr. Kurian, a longtime executive at the software company Oracle, to take over the business in 2018. He has beefed up the size of Google’s sales staff and pushed the company to compete aggressively for new contracts, including military deals.But Google employees have continued to resist some work pursued by the cloud unit. In 2019, they protested the use of artificial intelligence tools for the oil and gas industry. A year later, the company said it would not build custom A.I. software for the extraction of fossil fuels.Google started working on Project Maven in 2017 and prepared to bid for JEDI. Many Google employees believed Project Maven represented a potentially lethal use of artificial intelligence, and more than 4,000 workers signed a letter demanding that Google withdraw from the project.Soon after, Google announced a set of ethical principles that would govern its use of artificial intelligence. Google would not allow its A.I. to be used for weapons or surveillance, said Sundar Pichai, its chief executive, but would continue to accept military contracts for cybersecurity and search-and-rescue.Several months later, Google said it would not bid on the JEDI contract, although it was unlikely that the company had a shot at landing the deal: The Maven experience had soured the relationship between Google and the military, and Google lacked some of the security certifications needed to handle classified data.Google’s cloud business recently has done other work with the military. Since last year, Google has signed contracts with the U.S. Air Force for using cloud computing for aircraft maintenance and pilot training, as well as a U.S. Navy contract for using artificial intelligence to detect and predict the maintenance needs of facilities and vessels.Some Google workers believed the new contract would not violate the principles, a person familiar with the decision said, because the contract would enable generic uses of its cloud technology and artificial intelligence. The principles specifically state Google will not pursue A.I. that can be applied in “weapons or those that direct injury.”Lucy Suchman, a professor of anthropology of science and technology at Lancaster University whose research focuses on the use of technology in war, said that with so much money at stake, it is no surprise Google might waver on its commitment.“It demonstrates the fragility of Google’s commitment to staying outside the major merger that’s happening between the D.O.D. and Silicon Valley,” Ms. Suchman said.Google’s efforts come as its employees are already pushing the company to cancel a cloud computing contract with the Israeli military, called Project Nimbus, that provides Google’s services to government entities throughout Israel. In an open letter published last month by The Guardian, Google employees called on their employer to cancel the contract.The Defense Department’s effort to transition to cloud technology has been mired in legal battles. The military operates on outdated computer systems and has spent billions of dollars on modernization. It turned to U.S. internet giants in the hope that the companies could quickly and securely move the Defense Department to the cloud.In 2019, the Defense Department awarded the JEDI contract to Microsoft. Amazon sued to block the contract, claiming that Microsoft did not have the technical capabilities to fulfill the military’s needs and that former President Donald J. Trump had improperly influenced the decision because of animosity toward Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s executive chairman and the owner of The Washington Post.In July, the Defense Department announced that it could no longer wait for the legal fight with Amazon to resolve. It scrapped the JEDI contract and said it would be replaced with the Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability.The Pentagon also noted that Amazon and Microsoft were the only companies that likely had the technology to meet its needs, but said it would conduct market research before ruling out other competitors. The Defense Department said it planned to reach out to Google, Oracle and IBM.But Google executives believe they have the capability to compete for the new contract, and the company expects the Defense Department to tell it whether it will qualify to make a bid in the coming weeks, two people familiar with the matter said.The Defense Department has previously said it hopes to award a contract by April.",-0.030467077,"google 0.0424, contract 0.0272, cloud 0.0225, company 0.0190, defense 0.0155, military 0.0155, department 0.0143, would 0.0143, technology 0.0132"
Nov-21,"Google is reportedly “aggressively” working on winning a contract with the Pentagon, even though some of its previous Department of Defense work sparked major backlash from employees, according to The New York Times. According to the report, Google’s Cloud division has reassigned engineers to work on a proposal for Google to contribute to the Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability program, which the DoD describes as an attempt to “achieve dominance in both traditional and non-traditional warfighting domains.”The contract Google is reportedly looking into is one that will open to multiple companies to submit proposals and do work for, and the DoD estimates it could be a multi-billion dollar project. In a document describing what cloud providers will be expected to do, the DoD says that anyone hoping to win a contract will have to “enable access to crucial warfighting data” with a variety of classification levels (including Secret and Top Secret info). Additionally, the program requires that applicants be able to “provide advanced data analytics services that securely enable data-driven and timely decision-making at the tactical level.”Google says it has rules on how it can use AI with regards to the military, which it set after employee backlash. In 2018, reports came out that Google was developing AI tech to analyze video captured by military drones as a part of the Pentagon’s Project Maven initiative. Thousands of employees signed a letter to CEO Sundar Pichai saying that Google shouldn’t be involved in war and that the work put the company’s reputation at risk and went against its stated values. Eventually, the company gave in and said it would stop working on the project.After Google told employees it would let its Project Maven contract expire, it announced its AI ethics principles, promising that it wouldn’t work on AI-powered weapons or AI surveillance projects that were likely to draw ire from human rights or privacy advocates. The company did, however, say it would continue working with the military “in many other areas.”At the time, Google said any Pentagon work it pursued would have to fit within those principles. At this point, according to the Times, it’s unclear whether what the DoD wants would be allowed under those guidelines.The company has continued to do work with the military since its pledge, with some projects involving AI. As the Times reports, Google announced in August that its Cloud services would be used by a contractor to analyze footage from inspection drones to determine when Navy ships needed maintenance. The Air Force is also looking to use Google Cloud to help manage airplane maintenance. In a statement emailed to The Verge, a Google spokesperson said that the company is “firmly committed to serving [its] public sector customers, including the DoD.”Obviously, military-related work isn’t completely off the table for Google, but given its history, it’s likely employees pay extra-close attention when the company is looking to work with the Pentagon. Google employees’ responses to Project Maven helped kick off organization within the company — union organizers cited it as one of the collective actions that inspired unionization. The union has responded to the Times’ story about the current work on the DoD bid on Twitter, pledging that workers will fight the contract.",0.088096878,"google 0.0404, work 0.0377, company 0.0235, project 0.0207, would 0.0179, employees 0.0151, contract 0.0151, cloud 0.0150, military 0.0150"
Nov-21,"Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google said on Thursday it plans to allow third-party payment systems in South Korea to comply with a new law, marking the first time the U.S. tech giant has amended its payment policy for a specific country.Google's announcement comes after a Korea Communications Commission's (KCC) request for Google and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) to come up with compliance plans for the new law, which bans major app store operators from forcing software developers to use their payments systems. Most of the new law went into effect in mid-September. read moreThe curb is the first such move by a major economy on the likes of Apple and Google, which face global criticism for requiring the use of proprietary payment systems that charge commissions of up to 30%.In late August, parliament passed an amendment to South Korea's Telecommunications Business Act - dubbed the ""anti-Google law"" - banning big app store operators, such as Google and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) from forcing developers to use their payment systems, effectively stopping them from charging commission on in-app purchases.""We respect the decision of the National Assembly, and we are sharing some changes to respond to this new law, including giving developers that sell in-app digital goods and services the option to add an alternative in-app billing system alongside Google Play's billing system for their users in South Korea,"" Google said in a statement.Google, which charges developers a 15% service fee for distributing apps, said it would reduce this to 11% when users choose an alternative billing system, recognising that developers will incur costs to support their own billing system.It was unclear how beneficial that would be for developers.Google added that alternative billing systems may not offer the same protection or payment options and features of Google Play's billing system.The KCC said Google's plans would be implemented this year and would only apply to South Korea.""We were able to confirm Google's determination to comply with the law, and I hope (Google) will implement this policy change in a way to reflect the legislative purpose of the revised law,"" said KCC Chairman Han Sang-hyuk.In October, Apple told the South Korean government that it was already in compliance with the new law and did not need to change its app store policy.The KCC said it would ask Apple's South Korean unit for a new policy allowing greater autonomy in payment methods.

Nov-21,"If you’re going to install one outdoor security camera at your home, a floodlight camera is the best option. You get lights and a camera in one unit to capture all the action and you don’t have to mess with charging batteries or drilling holes through your walls for power cables — a floodlight cam can go wherever you have existing outdoor lighting. It’s a win-win smart home device. The only downsides are a high upfront price and a more involved installation. Unfortunately, the new Google Nest Cam with floodlight ($280) doesn’t solve either of these issues, being one of the more expensive floodlight cams and having the oddest design and installation process. But, despite these failings, it’s an excellent floodlight camera and has several benefits over the competition — which is multiplying.These benefits include a built-in battery backup for if the power goes out, intelligent motion sensing so the floodlights aren’t always going off when a moth flies by, and on-device processing that translates to much speedier alerts — crucial for a security camera.The Nest Cam with floodlight is functionally a Google Nest Cam (indoor/outdoor) magnetically attached to two, high-powered 2,400 lumen-producing, motion-sensing lights. It has all the same camera specs — 1080p HD video with night vision, a 130-degree diagonal field of view, two-way audio, IP54 weather resistance, and a built-in battery.It can also record up to three hours of event-based video clips for free and has free smart alerts for motion, people, vehicles, and animals. he specs are comparable to the competition, although it’s the narrowest field of view by 10 degrees. Ring offers 140 degrees in its Floodlight Cam Plus ($180), and Eufy’s $300 option has a 360-degree rotating camera and 2K video, which is the same resolution Arlo offers in its battery Flood Cam Pro 3 ($250) that can be powered with an AC adaptor. The new Wyze Floodlight Cam has the option of two cameras, so you can survey two angles over 130 degrees each. A siren is the one missing feature on the Nest Cam that’s found on all the competition. If you pay for Nest Aware, you do get the option to call 911 directly from the app, but the lack of a loud alarm to scare off a potential intruder is a big omission here. Additionally, both Eufy and Wyze have the option of onboard storage, so you don’t need to pay for a cloud subscription to view recorded video.With the Google Nest Cam, a Nest Aware subscription (starting at $6 a month) is essential if you’re planning to use this camera as a security device. While you get three hours of event-triggered recordings for free, that’s not going to do much good if there’s someone creeping around your property at 1 a.m. but you don’t see the alert until you wake up at 6 a.m.A subscription adds 30 or 60 days of event-based recordings, 24/7 continuous recording, the excellent Familiar Faces feature, and sound alerts — although only for carbon monoxide and smoke alarms, which is less useful for an outdoor camera. I do miss the “dog barking” and “people talking” alerts that came on the older Nest IQ cams. My colleague Dan Seifert reviewed the Google Nest Cam, and his thoughts apply here — this is a good camera with decent video quality. Still, it’s not as great as the Nest IQ cameras were, whose 4K sensors and longer digital zoom made it easier to hone in on details such as a name badge or license plate. The camera also can’t automatically zoom and pan as its predecessors could (and the Arlo can), a handy feature for an outdoor security camera as it can track someone further around your property. But when paired with the floodlights, the Google Nest Cam gets a clearer picture at night — the added lumens allowing for full-color night vision. While this doesn’t help with distance, it does provide more detail.Google has also implemented the lighting control nicely, giving you as much control over the floodlights as you get with any other smart light. You can turn them on and off and dim or brighten them with voice control or in the Google Home app. You can also add them into a Routine, so they can come on when you leave and turn off when you arrive home.These are security lights, though, so even on the dimmest setting, they’re still bright, and I wouldn’t plan on using them as outdoor accent lighting. There’s also plenty of control for deciding what triggers the lights and when. You can choose one or more from motion, live viewing, and any camera event (such as people, animals, vehicles) to activate the lights at night, and there are four daylight sensing options to determine how dark it has to be before they come on. There’s also a setting for how long the lights stay on once activated, from 10 seconds up to five minutes. In the Home app you can also turn them on or off like regular lights, with no timeout.There’s plenty of control for deciding what triggers the lights and when.These options significantly cut down how often I lit up the side of my house where I placed the camera. I set it to turn on only when it saw a person and created an activity zone to cut out my neighbors’ pathway, which is adjacent to mine. Compared to the Ring Floodlight Camera installed on the other side of my house (which also has person detection), it turned on much less frequently. I have two main issues with this camera: the Google Home app and the design. I’ll start with the app. The Home app does some things well — including lighting control, and it’s great that the floodlight is set up just like any other light in the app. But it’s not good for viewing or managing security cameras; specifically, the timeline view is clunky, and the route into viewing events is convoluted (although I do like the mini GIFs you get when you eventually land on the Full History page). The old Nest app is much better, but Google is moving away from it, and frustratingly, you can only use this Nest camera in the Google app.Case in point, there are no controls for the floodlights in the camera portion of the app. You can choose what turns them on in the camera settings, but you can’t adjust brightness, turn them on or off, or dim them there. Instead, you have to navigate over to the main Google Home control page — about six taps away — to do any of this. This feels like an oversight and is a frustrating user experience. As for design, Google over-thought this one. A floodlight camera is a simple concept: lights with a camera in the middle. Most of those on the market today look remarkably similar, but the Nest Cam with floodlight has a base that’s almost a foot long. This means if you’re installing on the side of your house on a wall, the camera extends outwards farther than others do — giving the motion sensor beneath it and the camera itself a better view. But if you install it under an eave — where all my existing floodlight wiring is (and I am not alone here) — you end up with a very long, ungainly looking device dangling off the side of your house. Installing the floodlight was also tricky, mainly because of this awkward positioning. Attaching the wiring was similar to any floodlight device; you need to hardwire it to your houses’ electrical wiring using a standard outdoor junction box (and if you’re not comfortable with wiring, especially while on the top of a ladder, I would highly recommend paying for a professional to install it — Nest offers this for $179).The problem came with getting the right angle for the camera. Because we had to install it essentially upside down, the very short wire that attaches the Google Nest Cam to the floodlights left little room for maneuverability. I couldn’t angle it high enough to capture the whole area I wanted to. Thankfully, the lights themselves have a lot more flexibility, and you can rotate them fully back and forth, and easily position them to cast the light where you want it and not into your neighbors’ window. Awkward design aside, the Google Nest Cam with floodlight performed very well in my testing. The lights respond accurately to the different motion events — only turning on for people, animals, or motion when those were selected.The lights also responded instantly to general motion events as those use the motion sensor on the floodlight. The smart motion activations (for people and animal) depend on the camera seeing the person or animal first, so they took a second or two longer.Alerts also came through on my iPhone 13 much faster than those on the Ring floodlight camera I’m also testing, likely due to the Nest’s on-device processing. However, Nest’s Familiar Faces feature still needs some work, telling me at one point it had spotted me outside, when it was actually the rather burly Comcast tech out there working with my connections.  If you are invested in the Google Home ecosystem, the Google Nest Cam with floodlight is your best option if you have the wiring in place. It’s a better choice than the battery Nest Cam and the Arlo Floodlight Pro 3, the only other floodlight camera that’s fully integrated with the Google Home app (where you can view footage in the app and on a Nest smart display). The Arlo has a similar price and can be installed without wires if that’s an issue, but the lighting isn’t as flexible.None of the new Nest Cams, which include an indoor/outdoor battery cam, indoor wired cam and doorbell cam, work with any other smart ecosystem. So, if you are running an Amazon Alexa or Apple HomeKit smart home, you should look at Ring, Eufy, Arlo or Netatmo’s Smart Outdoor Camera. These all work with Alexa, and the Netatmo and Arlo also work with HomeKit.

Nov-21," A group of U.S. states led by Texas have filed an amended complaint against Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google accusing the tech giant of using coercive tactics and breaking antitrust laws in its efforts to boost its already dominant advertising business.The updated allegations are the latest in an onslaught of regulatory scrutiny of Google over its practices. The tech company faces several lawsuits, including one by the Justice Department for monopolistic practices. read moreEarlier this week, Google lost an appeal against a $2.8 billion European Union antitrust decision. read moreThe amended U.S. lawsuit, filed in a federal court in New York late Friday, accuses Google of using monopolistic and coercive tactics with advertisers in its efforts to dominate and drive out competition in online advertising.The lawsuit also highlights Google's use of a secret program dubbed ""Project Bernanke"" in 2013 that used bidding data to give its own ad-buying an advantage. For example, in a 2015 iteration of the program, Google allegedly dropped the second-highest bids from publishers' auctions, accumulated money into a pool and then spent that money to inflate only the bids belonging advertisers who used the company's Google Ads.

Nov-21,"Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is launching an operation dedicated to drug discovery.The new company, called Isomorphic Labs, will build on recent research from DeepMind, a London-based artificial intelligence lab also owned and operated by Alphabet.Demis Hassabis, the co-founder and chief executive of DeepMind, will also serve as chief executive of Isomorphic Labs as it maps out its technical strategy and hires its first employees.Isomorphic and DeepMind announced the creation of the new company on Thursday, but declined to discuss the details of the operation.Other Alphabet companies are already exploring various aspects of human health, including Verily, which has worked on everything from surgical robots to contact lenses that monitor glucose levels in diabetics; and Calico, which is dedicated to overcoming aging. Isomorphic Labs will be focused solely on drug discovery and new technologies that can help develop medicines.Last year, DeepMind unveiled a system that automatically predicts the shapes of enzymes and other proteins, the microscopic mechanisms that drive the behavior of all living things. The system, called AlphaFold, could make those predictions with an accuracy well beyond other technologies, according to independent tests, and it could play an important role in drug discovery.The lab recently released predicted shapes of more than 350,000 proteins, a kind of map for biological processes in humans and other organisms. Independent researchers have used that data to accelerate a wide range of biological research, including efforts to understand the coronavirus.Other prominent research labs, including a team at the University of Washington, are exploring similar technology.

Nov-21,"Android has 2.5 billion users around the world and they all need to be on high alert after Google confirmed millions of users have been affected by dangerous new scams that came directly from the Play Store. The news comes following an investigation by Avast. The security specialist found 151 Google Play store-approved apps masquerading as games, custom keyboards, photo editors, QR code scanners and more, contain scams which trick users into receiving premium-SMS subscriptions which charge them up to $40 per month. And these apps have been downloaded over 10 million times by Android users from more than 80 counties, including the US. Avast warns that these scam payments can “go unnoticed for weeks or months” and even if affected users uninstall these apps, the charges will continue. Avast says the only way to stop them is to contact your carrier and request receipt of all premium SMS messages is disabled. In response, Google has confirmed Avast’s findings and removed all 151 malicious apps from the Play Store. This stops new users from being scammed, but those who have already downloaded the apps will continue to be in trouble until they are both uninstalled and your carrier is contacted. Avast has a full list of all the scam apps, which you would be wise to check. Google is not alone in approving damaging apps into its official store. Apple has repeatedly made headlines this year (1,2,3,4,5) for approving “factories” of scam apps in the App Store and even accidentally promoting them. Court documentation earlier this year also revealed Eric Friedman, Apple’s head of Fraud Engineering Algorithms and Risk, had described App Store security as “bringing a plastic butter knife to a gunfight” and “more like the pretty lady who greets you… at the Hawaiian airport than the drug-sniffing dog”.So beware: just because an app makes it into the Google Play Store or Apple App Store, that doesn’t automatically mean it is safe.

Nov-21,"Google asked the Justice Department on Friday to investigate whether its new top antitrust official, who has represented Google rivals, needs to step back from inquiries and lawsuits against the company.In a letter to Justice Department leaders, an outside lawyer for Google said the “reality, and the appearance, of partiality are fairly called into question” by Jonathan Kanter’s past work for the company’s critics. Google pointed to his work with Yelp and the News Media Alliance, which represents publishers including The New York Times Company.“Mr. Kanter’s past statements and work representing competitors who have advocated for the cases brought by the department raise serious concerns about his ability to be impartial,” Peter Schottenfels, a Google spokesman, said in a statement.Mr. Kanter, who was confirmed by the Senate earlier this week as the assistant attorney general for antitrust, has been a longtime behind-the-scenes player in building arguments against tech giants.Google’s lawyer said Mr. Kanter had represented Yelp in connection with an antitrust case filed against Google that was led by a group that included the Justice Department. Google also claimed that Mr. Kanter has represented critics in an investigation — led by Texas — into its ad technology business.The Justice Department declined to comment. Mr. Kanter did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.The request is the latest attempt by a tech company to discredit the regulators leading antitrust investigations into their practices.

Amazon has also asked that Ms. Khan be recused from any antitrust investigation into the company.While federal officials are supposed to avoid real or perceived conflicts of interest, experts have said that Mr. Kanter’s situation may be different because he is not switching sides in the cases against Google. Instead, he is going from being a Google opponent on behalf of private clients to arguing similar concerns on behalf of the government.Google also said that Mr. Kanter had made previous statements critical of Google that showed he had “prejudged” whether it had violated antitrust laws.

That story said Google is actively pursuing JWCC, after the Pentagon canceled a prior deal, the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) contract, in July. The question received almost 1,000 employee votes.CNBC obtained audio of the event, known as TGIF, and viewed a screenshot of the question.“The NYT reports that Google is aggressively pursuing the DoD’s Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability despite not bidding on its predecessor (JEDI) because it doesn’t align with its AI principles (no work on weapons or technologies that cause harm),” Pichai said, reading from the question on Dory. “What changed? What is the bid about and why is it ok?”Kurian responded by attempting to differentiate the contract from JEDI, a $10 billion deal that produced a legal battle between Amazon and Microsoft before the government canceled the contract altogether.“Recently, there’s been some discussion regarding Google’s interest in participating in the framework,” said Kurian, who joined Google in 2018 following a lengthy career at Oracle.“If selected as one of the compliant vendors, we are proud to work with the DoD to help modernize their operations,” Kurian said, appearing to read from a script. “There will be many areas where our product capabilities and our engineering expertise can be brought to bear with no conflict to Google’s AI principles.”Google established its AI principles after declining to renew a government contract called Project Maven, which helped the government analyze and interpret drone videos using artificial intelligence. Prior to ending the deal, several thousand employees signed a petition and dozens resigned in opposition to Google’s involvement.Google dropped out of the bidding for the JEDI contract in part because the company “couldn’t be sure” it would align with the company’s AI principles, it said at the time.Kurian on Thursday described how the DoD is the largest employer in the world with nearly 3 million employees. He said the JWCC is designed as a “procurement framework” for the 28 main agencies within the DoD. He also highlighted other work Google does for the U.S. government, such as helping agencies with weather predictions, working with the military to detect cancer and helping the Air Force with aircraft maintenance.Pichai and Kurian are navigating a sensitive issue for Google, as the company tries to bolster its cloud-computing division with high-profile deals while also placating an increasingly vocal and politically charged employee base. While Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page are still major shareholders in parent company Alphabet, they retired from their executive positions in 2019, leading to a dramatic cultural shift for a company that was once known for its idealism.Kurian isn’t expecting all of his staffers to get behind him on the JWCC.“We understand that not every Googler will agree with this decision,” Kurian said. “But we believe Google Cloud should seek to serve the government where it is capable of doing so and where the work meets Google’s principles and our company’s values.”‘No single vendor’Google went into greater detail on the topic in a blog post that Kurian published Thursday evening. In the post, Kurian described the JWCC as “essential to the success of the Department and the government in reducing costs, driving innovation, increasing productivity, and enhancing cybersecurity.” He added that the DoD should solicit assistance from numerous vendors, including Google Cloud.Kurian underscored that point at the meeting, telling employees that multiple vendors will be in on the deal, potentially giving each the option to choose where they want to focus.“That means no single vendor has to do all the work contemplated under the framework,” he said.Kurian said Google hasn’t put in a bid yet, and doesn’t know all the details because the request for proposal hasn’t been sent by the government. He didn’t address one specific detail from the Times story, which said Google’s cloud unit has already made the work a priority declaring it a “Code Yellow,” which allows the company to pull engineers onto the military project.A Google spokesperson told CNBC in an email that a “multi-cloud strategy” is the best solution for the government and said the company will evaluate “future bid opportunities” with its public sector customers, including the DoD.Pichai chimed in at Thursday’s meeting to tell employees that he hoped the discussion helped clarify the company’s position.“I think we are strongly committed to working with the government in a way that’s consistent with our AI principles,” he said. ",0.077204799,"google 0.0374, kurian 0.0227, company 0.0191, government 0.0190, cloud 0.0172, work 0.0151, principles 0.0116, deal 0.0116, help 0.0099"
Nov-21,"On Tuesday, the Senate confirmed Google critic and competition lawyer Jonathan Kanter to lead the Justice Department’s antitrust division, marking yet another progressive win in antitrust enforcement under the Biden administration.Kanter has a long history representing tech companies, like Yelp and Microsoft, in lawsuits accusing Google of anti-competitive behavior. Now that he’s been confirmed, Kanter will lead several Justice Department competition cases against big tech, including a monopoly lawsuit against Google alleging that the company maintains an illegal monopoly in the digital ads market. “Throughout his career, Kanter has [sic] been a leading advocate and expert in the effort to promote strong and meaningful antitrust enforcement and competition policy,” the White House said in a statement over the summer. Kanter is just the latest progressive favorite confirmed to lead the federal government’s crackdown on tech companies like Facebook and Google. In June, the Senate confirmed Lina Khan to chair the Federal Trade Commission. Khan first rose to prominence as a law student after authoring a 2017 paper titled “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox.” The paper argued that the government needs new antitrust laws to prevent anti-competitive conduct in the tech industry. The FTC has the authority to sue companies for anti-competitive behavior, and the agency is currently enmeshed in litigation against Facebook and Google. Kanter aligns closely with Khan and progressive antitrust scholar Tim Wu, who currently sits on the National Economic Council. Kanter’s history of leading lawsuits against big tech companies in the past has led to calls from critics for him to recuse himself from the DOJ’s active antitrust cases against Google. “Given that Kanter is famous for representing Microsoft and Yelp and attacking Google, Kanter will raise questions about his ability to impartially enforce the law against tech businesses, just like FTC Chair Khan,” said NetChoice vice president and general counsel Carl Szabo in a statement this summer.",0.197552448,"kanter 0.0413, antitrust 0.0323, google 0.0319, tech 0.0278, company 0.0233, lead 0.0233, khan 0.0192, confirm 0.0191, like 0.0149, competitive 0.0148"
Nov-21,"Google published the news in a new blog post, where it revealed an eye-popping 25 new vulnerabilities have been discovered in the last two weeks. It rates seven of these as ‘High’ level threats. Linux, macOS and Windows users are all affected and need to take immediate action. 11/17 Update: Chrome has run into further trouble after numerous reports from users that the new version (96) breaks access to major sites like Instagram, Twitter, Discord and more. Users receive the message: “Something went wrong. Try reloading.” When pages reload, they are often missing key elements like images, embedded videos and pages even render in the wrong color. Google itself has acknowledged these issues, with Google product manager Craig Tumblison confirming:”We're continuing to see user reports about this behavior, including reports from our social team."" Several workarounds have been attempted and disabling a new embedding feature introduced in Chrome 96 (""chrome://flags/#cross-origin-embedder-policy-credentialless"") has improved things for some users, though not all. At this stage, it is unknown if Google can apply a fix remotely without having to release a new version of Chrome. Either way, it leaves Chrome users in a difficult position with the choice of waiting and leaving known security vulnerabilities in the browser (details below) or updating and potentially breaking their browsing experience.[11/19 Update: Google has now confirmed that disabling the new embedding feature will fix the issue for most users]As is standard practice, Google is currently restricting information about these hacks to buy time for Chrome users to upgrade. Consequently, looking at the new High level threats, we only have the following information to go on:High - CVE-2021-38007: Type Confusion in V8. Reported by Polaris Feng and SGFvamll at Singular Security Lab on 2021-09-29High -  CVE-2021-38008: Use after free in media.

Reported by Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero on 2021-10-28High - CVE-2021-38011: Use after free in storage foundation. Reported by Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero on 2021-11-09These hacks follow a familiar pattern, with ‘Use-After-Free’ (UAF) exploits once more making up the majority of attacks. Successful UAF exploits topped 10x in both September and October and have been the cause of several ‘zero-day’ hacks as well. UAF vulnerabilities are memory exploits created when a program fails to clear the pointer to the memory after it is freed. Chrome V8 exploits have also been rife in 2021 along with Heap buffer overflow flaws. V8 is an open-source JavaScript engine which is used by Google Chrome and Chromium-based web browsers like Microsoft Edge, Opera, Amazon Silk, Brave, Yandex and Vivaldi. What You Need To DoIn response to these new threats, Google has released a major new update for Chrome, version 96.0.4664.45. Be warned, Google states that “this will roll out over the coming days/weeks” which means you may not be able to protect yourself immediately. To check if you are protected, navigate to Settings > Help > About Google Chrome. If your Chrome browser is listed as 96.0.4664.45 or higher, you are safe. If the update is not yet available for your browser, make sure you check regularly for the new version. Remember: after updating, you must restart your browser to be protected. This step is often overlooked. It is to Google’s credit that fixes for high level attacks are consistently released within days of their discovery, but they are only effective if billions of users subsequently restart their browsers. For anyone hesitant to update, the carrot is Chrome 96 also adds “back forward cache” which accelerates page loading times by storing a version of your most recently visited page(s) in memory. The stick is Google confirmed in July that there had already been more successful browser hacks by mid-2021 than in the whole of 2020. So make sure the very next thing you do is check your browser version. Right now.

Back in October last year, Google rolled out some big updates to Google Photos, including a new photo editor and powerful machine-learning-based filters such as Portrait Light and manual HDR controls. Originally Pixel exclusives, these advanced filters were then made available to anyone with an active Google One subscription, but only on Android.Now, as reported by 9to5Google, iPhone and iPad users can finally access the same features as on Android, including Portrait Light, Blur (for non-portrait-mode photos), Color focus, Smart Suggestions and HDR.These new features require iOS 14.0 or newer, at least 3GB of RAM and, of course, a paid Google One subscription. Not all filters work on all types of photos: For example, adjustments such as Portrait Light require a photo of a person to work properly.

Dec-21,"ARussian court slapped Alphabet Inc.’s Google with a fine of 7.2 billion rubles ($98 million) Friday for failing to remove banned content, the largest such penalty yet, as the authorities escalate a crackdown on foreign technology companies.The Moscow court cited the company’s repeated failure to comply with orders to take down content. The fine was calculated based on Google’s revenue, it said.Google is studying the ruling and then will determine its next steps, the company’s press service in Moscow said in a statement.Russia has stepped up its confrontation with foreign social media and internet companies this year in what the government calls a campaign to uphold its digital sovereignty. Regulators have levied fines and slowed content in a bid to force companies including Google and Twitter Inc. to delete posts encouraging unauthorized protests and other material deemed illegal.The government is also pushing tech companies to comply with its increasingly strict laws on localizing data storage. This year, Google and Apple Inc. removed a protest-voting app from their Russian stores during parliamentary elections after the authorities threatened to imprison their local staff.Until the latest ruling, however, fines for failure to remove content were generally insignificant. In September, Russia’s federal communications watchdog said companies that did not delete content could face fines of 5% to 20% of their annual local revenue.Google earned revenues in Russia of about 85 billion rubles in 2020, according to the Spark-Interfax database.“For some reason, the company fulfills decisions of American and European courts unquestioningly,” Anton Gorelkin, a ruling party deputy in the lower house of parliament who sits on the Information Policy committee, wrote on Telegram Friday. “If the turnover fine doesn’t bring Google to its senses, I’m afraid that some very unpleasant measures will be taken.”Friday’s ruling is the latest legal blow to Google in Russia, after a Moscow appeals court this month upheld an April ruling that ordered the U.S. technology giant to restore Tsargrad’s YouTube account or face escalating fines.

Dec-21,"Google has told its US staff they must be vaccinated against Covid-19 by the middle of January or face serious repercussions including a pay cut and ultimately the loss of their job.Employees were told they were required to have declared their vaccination status and uploaded proof of it, or to have applied for a medical or religious exemption, by 3 December, according to an internal memo obtained by CNBC, which first reported the story.After that date, Google said, it would start to contact workers who were unvaccinated or had not uploaded proof of vaccination, or whose exemption requests had not been approved.According to the memo, employees who missed a deadline of 18 January to comply with the rules would initially be placed on “paid administrative leave” for 30 days, followed by six months of “unpaid personal leave”. In the final step, Google would terminate the person’s employment.Google is one of several large US employers to have adopted a “no jab, no job” policy for their workforce, although it appears to have gone a step further than some other firms. Google declined a request to comment.It had already informed its US workforce that they would need to be vaccinated to return to its corporate buildings. The chief executive, Sundar Pichai, told staff in a memo in July that the policy would initially be implemented in the US before being adopted globally. Vaccination has also been made a requirement by other US tech companies including Uber and Facebook.Large American corporates have shown themselves to be much more likely to embrace a mandatory vaccination policy than their British counterparts. The US government has ordered companies with more than 100 staff to ensure their workforce is fully vaccinated or regularly tested for Covid by 18 January.The employment rights of UK workers, protected in law, have meant British employers are treading more cautiously. Employment lawyers have previously said that many companies and organisations feared accusations of discrimination or even unfair dismissal from staff, and therefore decided to make vaccination a personal choice.The UK government had to pass legislation to compel care homes to make sure all workers in England were fully vaccinated unless they had a medical exemption.US financial firms were among the most enthusiastic about bringing workers back to the office and also among the first to tell their teams during the summer that only fully vaccinated staff could return to their headquarters.On Tuesday the Wall Street bank JPMorgan informed its unvaccinated staff based at its Manhattan offices that they were required to work from home, amid concerns over the spread of the Omicron variant.

Dec-21,"Google passNot long ago, Google tried every internet trend. VR goggles, AR glasses, chat bots, social networks. The company practically invented the see-what-sticks approach to technological innovation.Today, if you trust most investors on Sand Hill Road, the internet’s future lies in web3, an umbrella term for services built around cryptocurrency tokens and blockchains. But on web3, Alphabet Inc.’s Google is remarkably quiet.It doesn’t have a crypto division, like Meta Platforms Inc., or a blockchain obsession, like Twitter Inc. Google doesn’t accept cryptocurrencies for ad buying, its payments service or its app store. Until recently, Google had banned several categories of crypto ads. Google hasn’t touched NFTs. In a recent interview with Bloomberg Television, Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai copped that he “dabbled” in crypto, but didn’t own any.Some staffers at Google have also dabbled with the technology, according to multiple current and former employees at the company. Still, Google hasn’t laid out a plan for inserting itself into web3.A Google spokesperson said its mobile payments service is “working with several companies” such as Coinbase, Bitpay and Gemini “to support crypto cards, which transact in fiat currencies.”There are a few reasons Google might not want to dive into the new arena—one is defensive. Web3 evangelists see the technology as “decentralized,” controlled by its many participants. They draw stark contrasts to the business models of Google, Facebook and Amazon. These boosters see the blockchain as inherently trustworthy, unlike the current web titans. “Can’t do evil > don’t be evil,” tweeted Chris Dixon, an Andreessen Horowitz partner, in a clear dig at Google. And many Silicon Valley visions for web3 activity, search engines and media decidedly don’t involve advertising, Google’s main business.But the company isn’t completely averse to cryptocurrency. Google has been willing to take crypto money for its cloud business. In September, the division signed a deal with Dapper Labs Inc., a Canadian blockchain company. It also has agreements with Hedera, Block.one and others. Given web3’s escalating computing demands, Google will certainly look to ink more of these. (Google will have to weigh crypto’s energy needs versus the company’s zero-emissions targets.)In some ways, the wait-and-see strategy is typical of Pichai, who has a more deliberate management style than his predecessors. And that doesn’t mean the company isn’t quietly exploring the technology. “I am confident they have a strong opinion on it already,” said Kushagra Shrivastava, a former Google marketer and vice president for crypto trading platform FalconX. Shrivastava is also a partner with Xoogler.co, a network and fund for former Google employees that has hosted demo days featuring emerging web3 businesses such as FalconX, OpenSea and Solana. There’s a Xoogler NFT, naturally.Google may be keeping tabs on the exploding industry through networks like these. Alphabet’s main investment arms, GV and capitalG, have backed web3 companies. These funds often finance companies in fields that Google, for various reasons, ignores. Shrivastava suggested that the company will keep making such “calculated bets” in web3 while regulation solidifies and mainstream adoption picks up. “And then [Google] will come in heavy,” he said.Another former employee had a different theory for Google’s soft-pedaling. The search giant is already dealing with an alphabet soup of regulatory agencies and headaches. Google may not be in a rush to invite in the SEC too.

Dec-21,"It's been over two years since our initial response to Google's Manifest V3 proposal. Manifest V3 is the latest set of changes to the Chrome browser’s rules for browser extensions. Each extensions manifest version update introduces backwards-incompatible changes to ostensibly move the platform forward. In 2018, Manifest V3 was framed as a proposal, with Google repeatedly claiming to be listening to feedback. Let's check in to see where we stand as 2021 wraps up.Since announcing Manifest V3 in 2018, Google has launched Manifest V3 in Chrome, started accepting Manifest V3 extensions in the Chrome Web Store, co-announced joining the W3C WebExtensions Community Group (formed in collaboration with Apple, Microsoft and Mozilla), and, most recently, laid out a timeline for Manifest V2 deprecation. New Manifest V2 extensions will no longer be accepted as of January 2022, and Manifest V2 will no longer function as of January 2023.According to Google, Manifest V3 will improve privacy, security, and performance. We fundamentally disagree. The changes in Manifest V3 won’t stop malicious extensions, but will hurt innovation, reduce extension capabilities, and harm real world performance. Google is right to ban remotely hosted code (with some exceptions for things like user scripts), but this is a policy change that didn’t need to be bundled with the rest of Manifest V3.Community response to Manifest V3, whether in the Chromium extensions Google group or the W3C WebExtensions Community Group, has been largely negative. Developers are concerned about Manifest V3 breaking their extensions, confused by the poor documentation, and frustrated by the uncertainty around missing functionality coupled with the Manifest V2 end-of-life deadline.Google has been selectively responsive, filling in some egregious gaps in functionality and increasing their arbitrary limits on declarative blocking rules. However, there are no signs of Google altering course on the most painful parts of Manifest V3. Something similar happened when Chrome announced adding a “puzzle piece” icon to the Chrome toolbar. All extension icons were to be hidden inside the puzzle piece menu (“unpinned”) by default. Despite universally negative feedback, Google went ahead with hiding extensions by default. The Chrome puzzle piece experience continues to confuse users to this day.The World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) WebExtensions Community Group is a welcome development, but it won't address the power imbalance created by Chrome’s overwhelming market share: over two-thirds of all users globally use Chrome as their browser. This supermajority of web users is not likely to migrate away because of a technical squabble about extension APIs. No matter what Google decides to do, extension developers will have to work around it—or lose most of their users. And since developers are unlikely to want to maintain separate codebases for different browsers, other browsers will be heavily incentivized to adopt whatever set of extension APIs that Google ends up implementing.Instead of working in true collaboration on the next iteration of browser extensions, Google expects Manifest V3 to be treated as a foregone conclusion. Participation in the WebExtensions group gives Google the veneer of collaboration even as it continues to do what it was going to do anyway. In short, Google enters the room as an 800-pound gorilla unwilling to listen or meaningfully work with the community.While Google's response to community feedback has been tweaks and fixes around the margins, we have been paying attention to what developers are saying. The shortcomings of Manifest V3 have come into focus.Requiring service workers for extensions is harmfulMost browser extensions are built around a background page, a place where all sorts of work happens out of sight as the user browses. With today’s Manifest V2, extensions in Chrome have the choice to opt into using an ephemeral “event”-based background page, or to use a persistent background page. Ephemeral pages get shut down and restarted repeatedly, whenever Chrome decides to do so. Persistent pages continue running as long as the browser is open. In addition to extension APIs, both kinds of extension background pages have access to the standard set of website APIs.Manifest V3 removes the choice, instead requiring all extensions to be based on “service workers.” Service workers are ephemeral, event-based, and do not have access to the standard set of website APIs. Along with removing the “blocking webRequest” mechanism, which we talk about below, rebasing all extensions on service workers is one of the most damaging changes in Manifest V3.Service workers are JavaScript scripts that run in the background, independent of the website that launched them. Service workers are meant to enable websites to perform previously hard or impossible tasks that optimize website performance or provide offline functionality. For example, the first time you visit twitter.com, the website installs a service worker in your browser. The service worker will stay installed, and may continue to perform tasks, even if you lose network connectivity or navigate away from twitter.com.Service workers give websites superpowers, giving web apps functionality that is otherwise difficult or impossible. But service workers don’t have the same freedom to execute code that websites do, and there are limits to how long service workers live. Each service worker listens for messages from its website, performs its tasks, and shuts down shortly after. This makes sense, as the website is the main actor that calls upon its service worker for help. But this model doesn’t translate well to browser extensions.Service workers were designed to work with websites, and they are a standardized part of the Web Platform. But there is no equivalent service worker standard for WebExtensions. Since extensions enhance the browser, applying the same execution limits from website service workers makes no sense, and yet this is exactly what Google has done.Websites and their service workers are developed by the same teams, and are meant to work in tandem. But browsers and browser extensions are built by different teams with different goals. Extensions are supposed to add new functionality that browser developers didn’t think of or intentionally left out. Sometimes, extensions do things that explicitly act against the intentions of the browser developers, such as when tracker blockers restrict the information flowing out of Chrome. Chrome continues to be the only major browser without meaningful built-in tracking protection. Web extensions need more freedom to operate on their own, which means first-class access to browser APIs and persistent memory.Take a look at the long list of known use cases harmed by requiring service workers. Seamlessly playing audio, parsing HTML, requesting geolocation, communicating via WebRTC data channels, and the ability to start a separate service worker are all broken under the new paradigm.Under Manifest V2, extensions are treated like first-class applications with their own persistent execution environment. But under V3, they are treated like accessories, given limited privileges and only allowed to execute reactively.As per feedback from Mozilla engineers, one legitimate benefit of service workers may be getting extensions to gracefully handle early termination on Android. But there are ways of achieving this goal that don’t involve this degree of harm. And if one of Google's aims for Manifest V3 is to help bring extensions to Chrome on Android, Google failed to communicate this information. How can browsers and extensions developers collaborate on moving extensions forward when it appears that Google is unwilling to share all of the reasons behind Manifest V3?declarativeNetRequest alone is inadequateBesides proposing to move extensions to an ill-fitting service worker foundation, Google’s Manifest V3 is changing the way that content-blocking extensions can function.Extensions based on Manifest V2 use webRequest, a flexible API that lets extensions intercept and block or otherwise modify HTTP requests and responses. Manifest V3 drops the blocking and modification capabilities of webRequest in favor of the new declarativeNetRequest API. The interception-only or “observational” webRequest API—which allows extensions to monitor, though not modify, requests—will supposedly remain in Manifest V3, although the API is broken in Manifest V3 at this time, with the relevant bug report open for over two years.As the name suggests, the new declarativeNetRequest API is declarative. Today, extensions can intercept every request that a web page makes, and decide what to do with each one on the fly. But a declarative API requires developers to define what their extension will do with specific requests ahead of time, choosing from a limited set of rules implemented by the browser. Gone is the ability to run sophisticated functions that decide what to do with each individual request. If your extension needs to process requests in a way that isn’t covered by the existing rules, you just can’t do it.From this follows the main problem with requiring a declarative API for blocking. Advertising technology evolves rapidly, and privacy extension developers need to be able to change their approaches to it over time. To make matters worse, extension developers can't depend on Google browser engineers to react in any timely manner or at all. Google abandoned extension API development for years before Manifest V3. For example, while extensions have had the ability to “uncloak” CNAME domains in Firefox for over three years now, Chrome still lacks support for CNAME uncloaking. And while this support may come at some point in the future as part of declarativeNetRequest, many years behind Firefox, what about uncloaking CNAMEs elsewhere, such as in observational webRequest?As we wrote in 2019, “For developers of ad- and tracker-blocking extensions, flexible APIs aren’t just nice to have, they are a requirement. When particular privacy protections gain popularity, ads and trackers evolve to evade them. As a result, the blocking extensions need to evolve too, or risk becoming irrelevant. [...] If Google decides that privacy extensions can only work in one specific way, it will be permanently tipping the scales in favor of ads and trackers.”We have many questions about how the declarative API will interact with other Google projects. Will Google’s Privacy Sandbox technologies be exposed to declarativeNetRequest? If declarativeNetRequest works exclusively on the basis of URL pattern matching, how will extensions block subresources that lack meaningful URLs, facilitated by another Google effort called WebBundles? As more tracking moves to the server, will Manifest V3 extensions be able to keep up? Is Manifest V3 a step down a path where the Google parts of the Web become unblockable by extensions?We reject declarativeNetRequest as a replacement for blocking webRequest. Instead, Google should let developers choose to use either API. Making both APIs available can still fulfill Google’s stated goals of making extensions safer and more performant. Google could use Chrome Web Store to guide extensions that don’t actually need blocking webRequest towards the declarative API. Google could also provide extension developer tools that would automatically analyze your extension for potential improvements, like the audit tools provided to promote best practices to website developers. In addition, extensions that use webRequest should get flagged for additional review; this should be clearly communicated to extension developers.Google’s performance claimsGoogle has claimed that part of the reason for its Manifest V3 restrictions is to improve performance. If extensions are allowed to have persistent background pages, the argument goes, then those pages will sit idle and waste memory. In addition, Google claims webRequest is an inefficient API because of how it traverses browser internals and extension code, and because it makes it possible for poorly implemented extensions to slow down Chrome. Google has provided no evidence to back these claims.In fact, many of the most popular extensions drastically speed up regular browsing by blocking resource-hogging ads and trackers. On the other hand, the restraints imposed by Manifest V3 will cause broken functionality and degraded performance for common extension tasks.While a persistent extension background page will continue to use memory as long as your browser is open, try opening Chrome’s Task Manager sometime. Then compare the memory consumed by each and every website you have open to the memory consumed by your (presumably far fewer) extensions. Then, if you are a user of privacy or ad blocking extensions, try disabling them and reloading your websites. This exercise should quickly put the lie to Google’s claims. The memory consumed by your various open websites—especially without the help of privacy and security extensions to block memory-intensive trackers and advertisers—should dwarf the memory consumed by the extensions themselves.Furthermore, repeatedly starting up and tearing down service worker-based extensions will lead to greater CPU load. For example, an extension using tabs, webNavigation, or observational webRequest APIs will get constantly invoked during browsing until either the user stops browsing or the five-minute time limit is reached. When the user resumes browsing, the service worker will have to get restarted immediately. Imagine how many times such an extension will get restarted during a typical day, and to what end?Any extension that depends on relatively expensive one-time processing on startup (for example, machine learning models or WebAssembly) is an especially poor fit for service workers’ ephemeral nature.Beyond harming performance, arbitrarily shutting down extension service workers will break functionality. The user may be in the middle of interacting with extension-provided functionality on some web page when the extension's service worker gets shut down. After a service worker restart, the extension may have stale or missing configuration data and won't work properly without the user knowing to reload the page. The additional delay caused by service worker startup will break use cases that depend on speedy messaging between the web page and the extension. For example, an extension that dynamically modifies the right-click menu based on the type of clicked element is no longer able to communicate within itself in time to modify the menu before it opens.Regressions and bugsOn top of everything else, Google’s rollout of Manifest V3 has been rushed and buggy.While you will no longer be able to upload new Manifest V2 extensions to the Chrome Web Store as of January 2022 (next month!), entire classes of existing extensions are completely broken in Manifest V3. As previously mentioned, observational webRequest is still broken, and so is native messaging. Manipulating web pages in the background, WebSockets, user script extensions, WebAssembly: all broken.Injecting scripts into page contexts before anything else happens (document_start “main world” injection) is also broken. This is critical functionality for privacy and security extensions. Extension developers have to resort to ugly hacks to accomplish this injection with configuration parameters, but they are all broken in Manifest V3, and the promised Manifest V3 replacement is still not available.Meanwhile, early adopters of Manifest V3 are running into bugs that cause their extensions to stop working when new extension versions are released. Even something as basic as internationalization is broken inside service workers.Mozilla’s disappointing responseMozilla, apparently forced to follow in Google's wake for compatibility reasons, announced it will also be requiring extensions to switch to service workers. While Mozilla will continue to support the blocking capabilities of webRequest, in addition to implementing declarativeNetRequest, it was framed as a temporary reprieve “until there’s a better solution which covers all use cases we consider important.”Recently, in a belated sign of community feedback finally having some effect, a Mozilla engineer proposed a compromise in the form of “limited event pages”. Limited event pages would lessen the pain of Manifest V3 by restoring the standard set of website APIs to extension background pages. An Apple representative expressed support on the part of Safari. Google said no.Instead of following Google into Manifest V3, Mozilla should be fighting tooth and nail against Google’s proposal. It should be absolutely clear that Google acts alone despite overwhelmingly negative community feedback. A proposal cannot become a standard when everyone else stands in opposition. Mozilla’s behavior is obscuring Google’s betrayal of the extensions ecosystem. Moreover, it gives a false sense of competition and consensus when in reality this is one of the prime examples of Google’s market dominance and anti-competitive behavior.ConclusionWhat is the future of extensions? As we explained in our 2019 response, removing blocking webRequest won’t stop abusive extensions, but will harm privacy and security extensions. If Manifest V3 is merely a step on the way towards a more ""safe"" (i.e., limited) extensions experience, what will Manifest V4 look like? If the answer is fewer, less-powerful APIs in service of “safety”, users will ultimately suffer. The universe of possible extensions will be limited to what Google explicitly chooses to allow, and creative developers will find they lack the tools to innovate. Meanwhile, extensions that defend user privacy and safety against various threats on the Web will be stuck in the past, unable to adapt as the threats evolve.The WebExtensions standard is what we all make it to be. If we are to take the WebExtensions Community Group at face value, we should be making extensions more capable together. We should indeed be making it easier to write secure, performant, privacy-respecting extensions, but not at the cost of losing powerful privacy-preserving functionality. We should make it easier to detect abuse, but not at the cost of losing the ability to innovate. We shouldn't rely on browser developers to think of all the needs of the diverse Web, and we don't have to: that's the beauty of extensions.The next extensions manifest version update should be opening doors to empower all of us, unconstrained by whether you can convince a few browser engineers of the validity of your needs. Google needs to cancel moving to service workers, restore blocking webRequest, and halt Manifest V2 deprecation until all regressions in functionality are addressed. Anything short of that is at best an insincere acknowledgment of developers' shared concerns, and at worst outright hostility to the extensions community at large.",0.027872298,"extensions 0.0368, manifest 0.0258, google 0.0246, service 0.0175, extension 0.0164, browser 0.0110, workers 0.0105, developers 0.0100, page 0.0100, chrome 0.0099"

All employees, including interns and the tech giant's extended workforce, will be eligible to receive the one-time cash bonus, a company spokesperson told Reuters. The additional bonus comes as many employees continue to struggle in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic. In March, an internal company survey revealed that its employees' wellbeing had dropped over the past year, and Google has tried to lessen the burden on its staff with work-from-home allowances and $500 wellbeing bonuses. The company spokesperson did not specify how much Google has reserved in total for its employee-wellness efforts.In early March 2020, Google advised all of its employees in North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa to work from home. Since then, the company has planned for an eventual hybrid schedule, which would require employees to come into the office three days a week.But plans for that hybrid model continue to be postponed.

Dec-21,"Google is finally making its own in-house smartwatch that’s set to launch in 2022, according to a person familiar with the matter and a new report from Insider.While Google has made its own smartphones for years under the Pixel line (which has since extended to other accessories, like wireless headphones), the company has never designed its own smartwatch, despite the fact that Google has had a companion wearable platform for Android since 2014.The watch (codenamed “Rohan”) is being worked on by Google’s Pixel hardware group separately from Fitbit, which Google bought for $2.1 billion earlier this year. According to Insider’s report, the new upcoming Google watch — it’s not clear whether Google will actually be calling it a “Pixel Watch” yet — will serve much the same role as the Pixel phones do for Android: an example for both consumers and hardware partners of what Google’s software is truly capable of when given the right hardware. The device is expected to cost more than a Fitbit and compete more directly with the Apple Watch, according to The Verge’s source.The watch will have basic fitness tracking features, including step counting and a heart rate monitor, with Google also reportedly working on debuting a Fitbit integration into Wear OS (codenamed “Nightlight”) with the new watch when it launches.Google is currently in the middle of the latest reinvention of its smartwatch platform with Wear OS 3. Unlike the earlier versions of Wear OS (or Android Wear), Wear OS 3 was developed as a partnership with Samsung, merging the Tizen platform into Google’s own. But so far, Wear OS 3 has only launched on Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 4, which runs a heavily customized version of the new operating system that eschews most of Google’s services and apps for Samsung’s own.Google nearly had a “Pixel Watch” in the past, according to a 2019 report. The LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style, released in 2017, were originally supposed to be marketed as part of the Pixel brand, but an employee told Insider that Google hardware boss Rick Osterloh axed the idea because they “didn’t look like what belonged in the Pixel family.” Both devices didn’t impress us when they came out.The news of a Google-built smartwatch isn’t a complete surprise, however. Osterloh told The Verge’s Dieter Bohn earlier this year that an in-house Wear OS wearable was already on the horizon, noting at the time that Google’s acquisition of Fitbit was still “pretty early in the integration.” Osterloh did mention that “you’ll see them [the Fitbit team] build wearables on Wear OS in the future,” with the team already “hard at work at that,” — although it’s not clear whether Osterloh was referring to the Rohan watch or a different, future product.",0.140102322,"google 0.0564, watch 0.0388, wear 0.0288, pixel 0.0253, fitbit 0.0183, accord 0.0149, smartwatch 0.0149, osterloh 0.0148, hardware 0.0148, android 0.0115"
Dec-21,"Over 2200 companies are confirmed to participate in person at CES 2022 in Las Vegas. Our focus remains on convening the tech industry and giving those who cannot attend in person the ability to experience the magic of CES digitally. CES 2022 will provide an opportunity for companies from around the world, both large and small, to launch products, build brands and form partnerships. Given CES’ comprehensive health measures — vaccination requirement, masking and availability of COVID-19 tests — coupled with lower attendance and social distancing measures, we are confident that attendees and exhibitors can have a socially distanced but worthwhile and productive event in Las Vegas, or while experiencing it online.Today started with big news from Lenovo, followed by Waymo and Intel. Now it seems that Google is extracting itself entirely from its in-person presence at CES. A spokesperson for the company tells TechCrunch:After careful consideration we have decided to withhold from having a presence on the show floor of CES 2022. We’ve been closely monitoring the development of the Omicron variant, and have decided that this is the best choice for the health and safety of our teams. We will continue to collaborate closely with both CTA and our partners to identify and support virtual opportunities, and we look forward to sharing the latest Google innovations with you all.Google’s decision to lean into a virtual presence isn’t entirely surprising, given the earlier news from fellow Alphabet subsidiary, Waymo. Still, the software giant has become a tentpole presence in recent years, as it has increasingly expanded its hardware footprint through its Nest line of home products and Pixel handsets. For the last several years, Google’s complex outdoor exhibits have been a mainstay in the Las Vegas Convention Center Parking lot.As of yesterday, the show’s governing body, the CTA, remains steadfast in its decision to keep the event going in early January, though big name losses continue piling up. The list of companies staying away from Vegas amid omicron concerns now also includes T-Mobile, AT&T, Meta, Twitter, Amazon, TikTok and Pinterest, along with a number of media outlets, including TechCrunch.We’ve reached out to the CTA in light of this latest news — a rough portent heading into a long holiday weekend. At the time of the organization’s last comment, cancelations amounted to 42 cancelations, comprising roughly 7% of the exhibit floor. That number has no doubt shifted since the last report, as both major players and startups have begun rethinking their presence at the show.No one wants to be the first big company to remove itself from an event, but the parallels to MWC’s cancelation in the early days of the pandemic are becoming more difficult to shake off.

Dec-21,"Google provides an excellent service to the world, enabling us to search the web for information, products and whatever else we're looking for. It even does the heavy lifting of determining which results are a ""best fit"" for our queries, providing us only with contextually relevant entries and ranking them in order of how trustworthy or authoritative those entries are. The higher-ranked a web page is, the more trustworthy Google thinks it is — which is good, because we're probably only interested in clicking that first entry in the SERPs.But this presents a secondary problem: rank manipulation. Motivated webmasters can undertake schemes and nefarious habits designed solely to manipulate their rank — and appear more trustworthy than they actually are.Google, in response, has designed countermeasures to identify instances of rank manipulation and penalize or remove them, accordingly. But just how good is Google at detecting rank manipulation?The problem with defining rank manipulationBefore we get too deep into this discussion, it's important to hash out the problems with defining ""rank manipulation.""Some examples of rank manipulation are egregious. In the early days of search engine optimization (SEO), it was common for people to spam keywords throughout their website to rank higher for that keyword term. For example, you might find a website simply consisting of the phrase ""best pizza NYC"" over and over again. This clearly serves no purpose other than keyword optimization, is bad for user experience and is unambiguous in its intentions.Other examples are harder to define. For example, it's considered rank manipulation to buy a link on another website for the purpose of boosting your rank; the same is true if you spam your link on another site, through something like a forum comment. If a publisher voluntarily chooses to link to your site, that's perfectly acceptable. But what if you pay to have an article featured on a high-profile publisher site and your article happens to include a natural link back to your site? Is that rank manipulation or not?It's hard for human experts to define exactly what rank manipulation is, so it's only natural that Google's ranking algorithm would struggle as well.Google's fight against rank manipulationCurrently, if you're found to be practicing rank manipulation, Google has two main tools to penalize you:Natural ranking effects. If you're using techniques that violate Google's quality standards, or if the quality of your work is deemed to be insufficient, your site might decline in rankings naturally. This usually happens immediately after a new algorithm update, and your rankings won't change too much in the process. You can often attribute it to natural volatility in search rankings after such an update.Manual actions. If you're found to be practicing egregious violations of Google's terms of service, you could face a ""manual action"" from Google itself. If this is the case, you may be blacklisted from Google search results altogether. Don't worry: If your site has been the target of a manual action, you'll know about it. Google will go out of its way to tell you about the penalty and give you a potential path to resolution. You can also check your current manual actions in Google Search Console.So what qualifies as ""rank manipulation"" in Google's eyes?Usually, it's one or more of the following:User deception/manipulation. If you deceive or mislead your users in any way, Google is going to catch you. Misleading redirects, masked links and other forms of manipulation are good ways to attract a penalty.Keyword spam. Ever since semantic search capabilities entered the equation, exact match keywords became less valuable. Even so, millions of webmasters still practice keyword spamming in an ever to rise in the rankings — and nearly all of them eventually catch a penalty.Link schemes. Link schemes include shady practices related to link building, such as buying links or participating in link circles. Any link scheme has the potential to earn you a penalty.Very low-quality work. Spammy links, poorly written content, and other low-quality works are likely to get you penalized.In other words, if you avoid these highest-priority violations, Google probably won't be able to flag you for rank manipulation, even if the actions you're taking are intended to increase your rankings.The bottom lineHow good is Google at detecting rank manipulation? It's good, but it's not that good. You're not going to get away with obnoxious violations of Google's webmaster guidelines. But if you're genuinely trying to create high-quality work and provide good user experiences, Google's not sophisticated enough to know your ""true"" underlying intentions.The best SEO strategies today are ones that result in genuinely good content and good overall user experiences. So is it even fair to qualify these actions as ""rank manipulation"" in the first place?",0.014681021,"rank 0.0542, google 0.0382, manipulation 0.0305, link 0.0243, good 0.0185, search 0.0126, action 0.0126, site 0.0125, quality 0.0106, user 0.0086"
Dec-21,"Google is releasing an update for its Pixel Buds A-Series wireless headphones, which will add a bass slider, a loudness compensation setting for better bass and treble response at low volumes, and a nice connectivity improvement (via Droid-Life). Given that the buds are only $99 (or free, if you got them with a Pixel 6 or 6 Pro preorder), it’s nice to see Google adding new features through software updates.As we learned earlier today, the Pixel Buds will be getting more control over the bass response. The buds had a “bass boost” option before, but now you’ll be able to turn up the bass using a four-step slider — and you can even turn it down a notch if that’s what you prefer.Google also says that if the Pixel Buds A-Series can’t connect to the last device you used them with, they’ll try to fall back to the device they were connected to before that. For example, if you were using the buds with your laptop that’s currently off, they could connect to your phone automatically when you take them out of the case if you had them connected to your phone before using them with your computer.Google says that the update, version 282, should be “rolling out over the coming days” and will install automatically if you’re using a Pixel running Android 10 or higher or if you’re using any phone with Android 6 or above that has the Pixel Buds app installed (as long as it has permission to see nearby devices).

Dec-21,"California’s civil rights regulator is investigating Google’s treatment of Black female workers following alleged incidents of harassment and discrimination, according to two people familiar with the matter and emails from the agency seen by Reuters.Attorneys and analysts at the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) have repeatedly interviewed several Black women who have worked at Alphabet Inc., Google's parent company, about their experiences there, according to the documents and the sources. The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing the work.Questions have centered on alleged harassment and discrimination in the workplace, according to the emails. Conversations have taken place as recently as last month, one of the sources said.The DFEH declined to comment.Google said it is focused on “building sustainable equity” for its Black workers and that 2020 was its largest year for hiring what it calls “Black+” workers, a designation inclusive of people belonging to multiple races.“Our goal is to ensure that every employee experiences Google as an inclusive workplace,” it said. “We’ll continue to focus on this important work and thoroughly investigate any concerns, to make sure our workplace is representative and equitable.”The DFEH has interviewed workers who have filed formal complaints and those who have not, the people said, showing that the regulator has sought more examples of potential mistreatment.The agency is involved in ongoing lawsuits against video game companies Tencent Holdings’ Riot Games and Activision Blizzard Inc., alleging widespread discrimination and harassment.But its cases do not always result in charges.For years Black men in the tech industry have said they have faced disparaging comments and discouraging experiences, such as being shut out of offices because security guards and colleagues questioned whether they actually worked there.As more Black women have joined the workforce, such complaints have increased. Seven current and former Google employees told Reuters this year about being marginalized on projects as Black women and not taken as seriously as colleagues with different backgrounds.Also earlier this year, an investigation by NBC News revealed that several Black, Latino, and other Google employees of color who had reported incidents of bias and discrimination were instructed to take medical leave. Some said they were eventually pushed out of their roles at the company.Artificial intelligence researcher Timnit Gebru has said Google fired her a year ago for criticizing its lack of workforce diversity and for fighting managers who objected to publishing a critical paper she co-wrote. Erika Munro Kennerly, who oversaw diversity and strategy teams at Google before resigning last year, told magazine Corporate Counsel in January that “there’s an overall tone of being undervalued” as a Black woman at Google.Workers identifying as “Black+ female” left Google at the highest rate of any racial-gender group other than “Native American+ female” last year, according to company data.

Dec-21," Google (GOOGL.O) has submitted proposals to the French antitrust watchdog about how it would deal with news agencies and publishers in a dispute about paying for news content, Google and the watchdog said on Wednesday.France's Competition Authority said in a statement it would put these proposals to a public consultation and the parties involved must respond by Jan. 31, 2022.News organizations, which have been losing ad revenue to online aggregators such as Google and Facebook (FB.O), have complained for years about tech companies using stories in search results or other features without copyright payment.As part of its proposals, Google commits to negotiate ""in good faith"" with news agencies and publishers the amount it would pay for using their protected content.It also commits to making a payment offer within three months from the start of the negotiation.If a deal cannot be reached, it would be possible to go to an arbitration court that would decide on the amount to pay.Google said on its Google France blog its proposals highlighted its willingness to open a new chapter in the copyright dispute.In November, Google began paying Agence France-Presse for its news content in a deal that follows France enacting a copyright law that creates ""neighboring rights,"" requiring big tech companies to open talks with news publishers that want a licensing payment.

Dec-21,"The launch of Google's Pixel 7 lineup is just around the corner, but the company has pretty much revealed it all, at least visually, ahead of its event this week. Google has already unveiled designs of its next-gen flagship phone series as well as the Pixel Watch (it has a round face). But at the Made By Google event in New York on Thursday, the company plans to reveal more about what's inside those devices. We're likely to see the new Tensor processor for its phones, among other things.Google first announced the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro at its annual developer conference in May, giving us an idea of what to expect from the company's upcoming flagship lineup. Thanks to the announcements made at Google I/O, we know both devices will launch in the fall with a new version of Google's Tensor processor, Android 13 and a more refined version of the Pixel 6's general design. That said, there are still a bunch of things we don't know. And that's where the rumor mill comes in -- to help us fill in the missing pieces (at least some of them) till the official event on Oct. 6. We'd suggest bookmarking this page since we'll update it whenever we get a whiff of any credible rumors. Release date: Pixel 7 will likely launch in October (confirmed)Google's flagship handsets have launched in October for years, ever since the first-gen Pixel was unveiled to the world. (Well, all of them except for the Pixel 5, which was unveiled at the end of September.)  And this year is no different: Google's announcement of its Oct. 6 event was accompanied by a video showing the Pixel 7 series, which makes it clear the phone will be the main focus of the event. Google also said pre-orders will start on Thursday next week.Processor: Pixel 7 set to run on second-gen Tensor chip (confirmed)Google's in-house silicon, known as the Tensor chip, made its debut in the Pixel 6 series. And Google will continue to pack its phones with its own chips with the upcoming Pixel 7 lineup. It's set to receive a second-gen Tensor chipset, the company said in May. This announcement isn't surprising: Google took on the costly and complex task of developing an in-house chipset, so why not use that chipset in its phones?Some of the enhancements from the chip are evident in the Pixel 6's camera system, which has new features that aren't available on previous Pixel devices. These include Magic Eraser for deleting unwanted objects in photos and Real Tone, which portrays skin tones more accurately. Although we don't know much about the second-gen Tensor chip yet, we can likely expect similar machine learning-based improvements. Design: Pixel 7 changes bar and camera cutouts (confirmed)Last year's Pixel 6 shook up the design that the last five generations of Pixel phones otherwise held onto. After that design overhaul, Google is simply making refinements to its now signature aesthetic. Remember the black camera bar that runs across the width of the chassis? This year, the bar will be made of recycled aluminum and flows into the device's side rails, making the camera cutouts more visible. (The Pixel 6 series had a bold black bar that abruptly stopped at the edges).Design: Pixel 7 to feature a punch-hole front camera (confirmed)Images shared by Google in May show Pixel 7 will have a pill-shaped camera notch while the Pixel 7 Pro will feature a punch-hole cut out and a pill-box cut out that together form a sort of sideways exclamation point, housing three cameras. The Pixel 7 has virtually the same design as its larger sibling, apart from size and the presence of an extra rear camera in the 7 Pro. Cameras: Pixel 7 Pro will feature three rear cameras, the Pixel 7 will have two (confirmed)Google renders show the Pixel 7 Pro will also have a triple rear camera system, like the 6 Pro, while the base Pixel 7 seems to have two rear cameras, like the standard Pixel 6. As far as the cameras go, we don't have confirmation of much more beyond that, but the pictures seem to show that Google will stick to the configurations of standard wide, ultrawide and telephoto for the Pixel 7 Pro.Price: Pixel 7 series pricing won't change (unconfirmed)Rumors regarding the Pixel 7 price are starting to surface. One that sticks out is from Android Police founder Artem Russakovksii, who says the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro will cost $599 and $899, respectively -- the same prices as last year's models. Russakovksii shared this information in a post on Twitter last week, citing what he says is a trusted source. If this pans out, Google will have joined both Apple and Samsung in not raising the starting price of their new phones.

Pichai is subject to up to two hours of testimony under an order issued Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.The lawsuit, filed in June 2020, alleges that Google tracks users even when they’re browsing in incognito mode. Google disputes the claims, arguing that its privacy disclosures make clear that the private browsing mode doesn’t make user activities “invisible” online.In an earlier order, Judge Lucy Koh also allowed consumers to question Google’s chief marketing officer, Lorraine Twohill, about incognito’s branding as private.Google has tried to toss the claims from consumers, but so far Koh has let them proceed. The company also argued against questioning Pichai, saying lower-level employees responsible for Chrome and the incognito mode are better suited to answering inquiries about private browsing.While Google disputes the consumers’ claims, the company has cooperated with their “countless requests” during the evidence-gathering stage of the lawsuit, Google spokesman José Castañeda said in an email. “These new requests are unwarranted and overreaching,” Castañeda said.The consumers in the suit are represented by lawyers from Boies Schiller Flexner LLP, Susman Godfrey LLP, and Morgan & Morgan PA. Lawyers from Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP represent Google.The case is Brown v. Google LLC, N.D.

Jan-22,"Three states and the District of Columbia allege that the tech giant misled consumers by continuing to track those who had changed their privacy settings to prevent data collection. The District of Columbia and three states sued Google on Monday, claiming that the tech giant deceived consumers to gain access to their location data.In separate lawsuits, the attorneys general of the district, Texas, Washington and Indiana claimed that Google misled users of Android phones and of tools like Google Maps and its search engine by continuing to track location information of users who had changed privacy settings to prevent the data collection.Karl A. Racine, the attorney general for the District of Columbia, led the complaints after a three-year investigation, which was initiated after a report by The Associated Press showed that the company recorded users’ movements even when told not to. He said investigators had found that since at least 2014, Google made misleading and conflicting claims to consumers about privacy protections offered via its account settings.The District of Columbia lawsuit alleged that even after users changed the settings in their account or device to stop location tracking, Google collected and stored that information through Google services, Wi-Fi data and marketing partners. The search giant also misled and pressured users to enable more location tracking, for example by claiming products would not function properly if the location services setting was disabled when in fact it was not needed to use the app, according to the suit.“Google falsely led consumers to believe that changing their account and device settings would allow customers to protect their privacy and control what personal data the company could access,” Mr. Racine said in a statement. “The truth is that contrary to Google’s representations it continues to systematically surveil customers and profit from customer data.”Google said that the allegations brought by the attorneys general were false and that it had put in place many changes to its privacy policies to help users protect their location data.“The attorneys general are bringing a case based on inaccurate claims and outdated assertions about our settings,” said Jose Castaneda, a spokesman for Google. “We have always built privacy features into our products and provided robust controls for location data. We will vigorously defend ourselves and set the record straight.”Google is also fighting an antitrust lawsuit led by Texas in which states have accused the company of obtaining and abusing a monopoly over the systems that allow publishers to auction off ad space to marketers. On Friday, Google asked a federal court to dismiss the lawsuit.The lawsuits add to a mounting offensive by regulators to curtail the power and business practices of Silicon Valley giants like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple. State and federal regulators have filed dozens of antitrust, consumer protection, privacy and trade lawsuits in an attempt to curb the business models or break up the companies. A Senate committee last week advanced potentially landmark antitrust legislation that tries to weaken the dominance of the internet giants.Mr. Racine and the attorneys general of Texas, Washington and Indiana said their suits, filed under local consumer protection laws, sought to fine Google and to stop its practice of collecting location data collection for users who have opted out. The attorneys general also have joined in other antitrust lawsuits against Google for allegedly harming competition in search and advertising technology.“Google has prioritized profits over people,” The Indiana attorney general, Todd Rokita, said. “It has prioritized financial earnings over following the law.”",0.007795699,"google 0.0394, data 0.0225, location 0.0201, users 0.0177, general 0.0176, privacy 0.0176, settings 0.0153, claim 0.0128, change 0.0128"
Jan-22,"Google’s chief executive approved an agreement with Facebook at the heart of an antitrust lawsuit that 16 states and Puerto Rico have lodged against the search giant, according to a portion of the complaint revealed on Friday.The lawsuit, led by the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, argues that Google has obtained and abused a monopoly over the network of technology used to deliver ads online.When publishers started using an alternative system for selling their ad space, Google worked to undermine it by creating a similar system that it controlled, according to the lawsuit. The states argue that Google reached a deal with Facebook to have the social network join its effort in an effort to “kill” the publishers’ competing plan.In the newly unredacted portion of the lawsuit, filed in federal court, the states said that Sundar Pichai, the company’s chief executive officer since 2015, “also personally signed off on the terms of the deal.”The newly visible parts of the lawsuit also include details of programs that the states say Google used to mislead buyers and sellers of ad space about the precise nature of the auctions they were participating in, allowing Google to make more money in the process.A Google spokesman said that the complaint was “still full of inaccuracies and lacks legal merit.”“We sign hundreds of agreements every year that don’t require C.E.O. approval, and this was no different,” the spokesman said.In another newly public portion, the states quote a February 2017 “Facebook document” that says that Google wanted to “kill” the competing system and that Facebook “baptizing their product will help significantly.”At one point, Facebook employees working on the deal emailed Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s founder and chief executive, saying “We’re nearly ready to sign and need your approval to move forward.” Mr. Zuckerberg’s name is still redacted from the lawsuit, but his title is not.In a statement, a spokesman for Meta, Facebook’s parent company, said that its deal with Google “and the similar agreements we have with other bidding platforms have helped to increase competition for ad placements.”The antitrust lawsuit is one of several filed by government agencies against tech giants in the last two years. The Justice Department and a group of states have sued Google arguing that it has abused a monopoly over online search. This week, a judge said that the Federal Trade Commission could move forward with a lawsuit against Facebook. Both Apple and Amazon also are facing antitrust inquiries.The judge in the case has said that Google has until Jan. 21 to respond to the latest version of the lawsuit.

Jan-22,"Google has warned of a “devastating” impact on the internet if a court ruling that the search giant is liable for defamatory material contained in hyperlinked pages is not overturned.Google warned in a submission to the high court it will be forced to “censor” its search results if a $40,000 defamation damages award to George Defteros, a solicitor who represented Melbourne gangland figures, is allowed to stand.Defteros successfully sued Google, arguing its publication of search results that included a 2004 article in the Age about his arrest on conspiracy to murder charges – which were later dropped – defamed him.In 2020, the Victorian supreme court justice Melinda Richards ruled the article had implied that Defteros crossed a line from professional lawyer to confidant and friend to criminal elements. Victoria’s court of appeal rejected a bid from Google to overturn the result.Defteros’ lawyers had contacted Google in 2016 asking for the article to be removed but it refused on the basis the Age was a reputable source.Google’s lawyers told the high court the notice contained “false” claims that Defteros had sued the Age in defamation and the Age had agreed to remove it from its website.Google warned if the court of appeal judgment stands “Google will be liable as the publisher of any matter published on the web to which its search results provide a hyperlink” after a person complains the matter defamed them – “regardless of the quality” of that notice.Even if many of those accessing the article had a “legitimate interest” in it, which should enable the defence of qualified privilege, the search engine would be required to block search results for everyone or else be held liable for those accessing it out of “idle curiosity”, Google said.The tech company argued that it was not a publisher of the material because “a hyperlink is not, in and of itself, the communication of that to which it links”. Websites should only be liable if the hyperlink “actually repeats the defamatory imputation to which it links”, Google said.“The inevitable consequence of leaving the court of appeal’s decision undisturbed is that Google will be required to act as censor by excluding any webpage about which complaint is made from its search results, even when, as here, the webpage may be a matter of legitimate interest to the substantial portion of people who search for it and is published by a reputable news source.”Google argued it should be entitled to the “innocent disseminator” defence unless a complainant could explain what the defamatory meanings of the article were and why they could not be defended.It also asked the high court to reconsider the defence of qualified privilege, arguing it “believed on reasonable grounds” that its users had a legitimate interest in accessing the article.In 2018, the court gave the green light to defamation claims against search engines in a case brought by Milorad Trkulja against Google for a series of images, autocomplete predictions and results that he alleged were defamatory.In September last year, the high court ruled in the Dylan Voller case that social media users, including media companies, were liable as publishers for defamatory third-party comments on their social media posts.In December, the Coalition released draft legislation to counteract the Voller decision by deeming that an Australian person or company with a social media page was not the publisher of third-party comments made by other users.If passed, the bill would deem the social media company the publisher but would provide them with a defence if they had a complaints procedure to help identify anonymous commenters.",0.022927928,"google 0.0355, court 0.0274, search 0.0248, result 0.0196, article 0.0168, defamatory 0.0142, media 0.0142, defteros 0.0142, liable 0.0141, social 0.0115"
Jan-22,"In 1998, a computer science PhD student called Larry Page submitted a patent for internet search based on an obscure piece of mathematics. The method, known today as PageRank, allowed the most relevant webpages to be found much more rapidly and accurately than ever before. The patent, initially owned by Stanford, was sold in 2005 for shares that are today worth more than $1bn. Page’s company, Google, has a net worth of well over $1tr.It wasn’t Page, or Google’s cofounder Sergey Brin, who created the mathematics described in the patent. The equation they used is at least 100 years old, building on properties of matrices (mathematical structures akin to a spreadsheet of numbers). Similar methods were used by Chinese mathematicians more than two millennia ago. Page and Brin’s insight was to realise that by calculating what is known as the stationary distribution of a matrix describing connections on the world wide web, they could find the most popular sites more rapidly.Applying the correct equation can suddenly solve an important practical problem, and completely change the world we live in.The PageRank story is neither the first nor the most recent example of a little-known piece of mathematics transforming tech. In 2015, three engineers used the idea of gradient descent, dating back to the French mathematician Augustin-Louis Cauchy in the mid-19th century, to increase the time viewers spent watching YouTube by 2,000%. Their equation transformed the service from a place we went to for a few funny clips to a major consumer of our viewing time.From the 1990s onwards, the financial industry has been built on variations of the diffusion equation, attributed to a variety of mathematicians including Einstein. Professional gamblers make use of logistic regression, developed by the Oxford statistician Sir David Cox in the 50s, to ensure they win at the expense of those punters who are less maths-savvy.There is good reason to expect that there are more billion-dollar equations out there: generations-old mathematical theorems with the potential for new applications. The question is where to look for the next one.A few candidates can be found in mathematical work in the latter part of the 20th century. One comes in the form of fractals, patterns that are self-similar, repeating on many different levels, like the branches of a tree or the shape of a broccoli head. Mathematicians developed a comprehensive theory of fractals in the 80s, and there was some excitement about applications that could store data more efficiently. Interest died out until recently, when a small community of computer scientists started showing how mathematical fractals can produce the most amazing, weird and wonderful patterns.Another field of mathematics still looking for a money-making application is chaos theory, the best-known example of which is the butterfly effect: if a butterfly flaps its wings in the Amazon, we need to know about it in order to predict a storm in the North Atlantic. More generally, the theory tells us that, in order to accurately predict storms (or political events), we need to know about every tiny air disturbance on the entire planet. An impossible task. But chaos theory also points towards repeatable patterns. The Lorenz attractor is a model of the weather that, despite being chaotic, does produce somewhat regular and recognisable patterns. Given the uncertainty of the times we live in, it may be time to revive these ideas.Some of my own research has focused on self-propelled particle models, which describe movements similar to those of bird flocks and fish schools. I now apply these models to better coordinate tactical formations in football and to scout players who move in ways that create more space for themselves and their teammates.Another related model is current reinforced random walks, which capture how ants build trails, and the structure of slime mould transportation networks. This model could take us from today’s computers – which have central processing units (CPUs) that make computations and separate memory chips to store information – to new forms of computation in which computation and memory are part of the same process. Like ant trails and slime mould, these new computers would benefit from being decentralised. Difficult computational problems, in particular in AI and computer vision, could be broken down in to smaller sub-problems and solved more rapidly.Whenever there is a breakthrough application of an equation, we see a whole range of copycat imitations. The current boom in artificial intelligence is primarily driven by just two equations – gradient descent and logistic regression – put together to create what is known as a neural network. But history shows that the next big leap forward doesn’t come from repeatedly using the same mathematical trick. It comes instead from a completely new idea, read from the more obscure pages of the book of mathematics.The challenge of finding the next billion-dollar equation is not simply one of knowing every page of that book. Page spotted the right problem to solve at the right time, and he persuaded the more theoretically inclined Brin to help him find the maths to help them. You don’t need to be a mathematical genius yourself in order to put the subject to good use. You just need to have a feeling for what equations are, and what they can and can’t do.Mathematics still holds many hidden intellectual and financial riches. It is up to all of us to try to find them.

Jan-22,"If you have multiple Google smart speakers in your house, you might want to be aware of a certain legal ruling — because it’s going to affect how your speaker groups work. After the US International Trade Commission ruled that it was infringing on Sonos’ patents, Google has already announced software workarounds including the “need to adjust each speaker individually instead of using the group volume controller,” and that users will no longer be able to adjust a speaker group’s volume with their phone’s volume rocker. It blames this change on “a recent legal ruling,” one which you can read all about right here.When news of the patent decision broke, Google told The Verge it had gotten non-infringing designs approved by the ITC. Sonos warned, however, that Google might have to “degrade or eliminate product features” to be compliant, and that certainly seems to be what’s happening. We just didn’t necessarily expect it to play out this soon, given that Google has 60 days to get its devices into compliance.The changes seem like pretty big downgrade to Google’s multi-room audio feature that lets you synchronize speakers together and have them play all at once. For instance, instead of being able to say “hey Google, set volume to 40 percent on Living Room speakers,” you’ll have to change the volume for each one, using either the assistant, Google Home app, or a Nest Hub display.Google also says that “a small set of users” will need to use a specific app to set up their smart devices and update them, and Google is warning users that if their speaker group contains products from other manufacturers, they may need to be updated to the latest firmware to continue functioning as part of that speaker group.

Jan-22,"France’s data privacy watchdog has fined Google and Facebook a combined €210m (£176m) for hampering users’ ability to stop the companies tracking their online activity.The Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL) said on Thursday it had fined Google a record €150m for making it difficult for internet users to refuse cookies – small text files that build up a profile of a person’s web activity for commercial purposes. It fined Facebook €60m for the same reason.Internet users’ prior consent for the use of cookies is a key pillar of the EU’s data privacy regulation, and a top priority for the CNIL.“When you accept cookies, it’s done in just one click,” said Karin Kiefer, CNIL’s head of data protection and sanctions. “Rejecting cookies should be as easy as accepting them.”The watchdog said the facebook.com, google.fr and youtube.com websites did not allow the easy refusal of cookies. Citing the example of Facebook, it said: “Several clicks are required to refuse all cookies, as opposed to a single one to accept them.”It said the companies had three months to comply with its orders, including making it easier for French users to decline cookies, or face extra penalty payments of €100,000 for every day of delay.A Google spokesperson said: “People trust us to respect their right to privacy and keep them safe. We understand our responsibility to protect that trust and are committing to further changes and active work with the CNIL in light of this decision.”A spokesperson for Facebook’s parent company, Meta, said: “We are reviewing the authority’s decision and remain committed to working with relevant authorities. Our cookie consent controls provide people with greater control over their data, including a new settings menu on Facebook and Instagram where people can revisit and manage their decisions at any time, and we continue to develop and improve these controls.”In 2020, the CNIL strengthened consent rights over ad trackers, saying websites operating in France should keep a register of internet users’ refusal to accept cookies for at least six months.It also said internet users should be able to easily reconsider any initial agreement concerning cookies via a weblink or an icon that should be visible on all pages of a website.",0.130692641,"cookies 0.0378, users 0.0257, facebook 0.0257, cnil 0.0216, internet 0.0176, google 0.0175, accept 0.0175, data 0.0175, control 0.0135"

Jan-22,"Sorry, ornithophiles, the next version of the Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC) proposal doesn’t have a bird name.On Tuesday, just a few days after filing a motion to dismiss the state AG-led antitrust lawsuit against its advertising business, Google announced Topics, a new proposal for the Privacy Sandbox that replaces the FLoC API, which is being sent to bird heaven.The new proposal – you can consider it FLoC 2.0 – was developed based on feedback gathered from the industry during the first set of FLoC origin trials last year.Rather than placing people into cohorts or buckets based on their browsing history – in other words, replacing the third-party cookie with a FLoC ID – the Topics API, as the name denotes, allows companies to personalize ads based on a limited number of regularly updated content topics as determined by the browser.But what does that mean exactly?On topicLike the FLoC API, the Topics API uses on-device machine learning. None of the data processing happens on an external server, including Google servers, using this approach.But unlike FLoC, which generated a cluster ID to reflect a given Chrome user’s browsing patterns, the Topics API allows Chrome to determine up to five topics – think things like fitness, travel, books, team sports or rock music – that represent a person’s top interests for a certain week across participating websites (as in, websites that choose to call the Topics API).When someone visits a participating site, the Topics API picks three topics for targeting purposes – one topic from each of the past three weeks – and shares them with that site and its advertising partners to personalize ads to that person.Shared topics are persistent to a website and only remain active for three weeks. Then they’re deleted, and fresh topics are added in their place. The API supplies multiple topics so they can be combined (for example, targeting a book lover who is also into fitness).In contrast to third-party cookies, which allow advertisers to track users and build profiles about them as a path toward understanding what topics they might be interested in, the Topics API enables the browser to share a brief list of advertising topics that might correspond to a user’s interests. Less data is available for targeting, and the data expires much more quickly.“That provides a more private alternative than tracking to help deliver relevant ads,” Ben Galbraith, who leads product for Google Chrome’s web platform team, told AdExchanger.Topics vs. contextualThere’s a whiff of contextual targeting about the topics-based approach to interest-based advertising. But the Topics API allows for more nuanced targeting than contextual, Galbraith said.For instance, in some cases, context is used to disqualify certain content from monetization, like a news story about a tragic event.But like classic behavioral targeting, which decouples context from a user’s interests, the Topics API could be used to target a fitness lover on a news site regardless of whether someone is reading about fitness.“We see Topics as an input [for] advertisers so they can look at various signals and make their own decision about what makes an ad most relevant in a given situation,” Galbraith said.FLoC feedbackThe decision to replace FLoC with the Topics API was based largely on the comments and reactions that came in during the FLoC testing process.One of the biggest pieces of feedback was that FLoCs are not necessarily more privacy-preserving than status quo cookies. During extensive testing of FLoC conducted over the summer, for example, Criteo found that it was still possible to use FLoC IDs to do cross-site tracking by monitoring browsing habits and cohort assignments over time.FLoCs also didn’t address the issues of fingerprinting or sensitive category targeting.In response, the Topics API pulls from topics curated by humans rather than machines to ensure they don’t include sensitive categories, such as sexual orientation, religion and race.Users will eventually be able to see what topics are being shared about them or disable the feature completely. Chrome is in the process of building those user controls.The initial set of topics – roughly 350 to start – will be pulled from a combination of the IAB content taxonomy and Google’s own audience taxonomy. Google will consider expanding the available topic list based on testing and feedback.Down the line, Google will look for a third party to maintain the Topics taxonomy. The IAB Tech Lab is one potential option, Galbraith said. (Seems like everyone wants a piece of the IAB Tech Lab these days.)Although cohort IDs “had some benefits” from a technical perspective, users found it hard to understand what they meant, Galbraith said. Similar to cookies, cohort IDs were just alphanumeric strings.Sharing user-understandable topic names represents a big improvement for users, Galbraith said, compared to FLoC’s “synthetic identifier that represented a cohort that was just really hard to understand.”To mitigate fingerprinting, Chrome will purposely limit the number of topics that can be shared and alter the information a website receives “to make it really difficult to triangulate on the same user if folks were trying to abuse the API to do that,” Galbraith said.Topics to the testThe Topics API will be available for origin trial testing toward the end of the first quarter, Galbraith said. Google will share firmer details on the exact timeline soon.But … what about Europe? Google wasn’t able to proceed with FLoC testing in Europe due to concerns over compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation.As of now, Topics testing will be a go in the EU. “Our aim is for this to be a global test,” Galbraith said.Although it’s too early to say what sort of performance to expect – both compared to FLoC and compared to third-party cookies – Galbraith said Google has “hopes this will provide solid utility … otherwise, we wouldn’t go through this process.”Beyond Topics, Google plans to release more information to developers later this week about FLEDGE, its Privacy Sandbox proposal for retargeting, and more info on its technical proposals focused on measurement. FLEDGE testing hasn’t started yet, but should begin in the near term, Galbraith said.(Anti)trust usBut while Google and the Chrome team busy themselves in the Privacy Sandbox, they do so against a backdrop of increasing antitrust and regulatory scrutiny in the US, Europe and farther afield.In November, Google submitted a set of revised commitments for oversight of the Privacy Sandbox to the Competition and Markets Authority, the UK’s top antitrust regulator, including a pledge not to remove third-party cookies from Chrome without the CMA’s authorization. Google also promised not to discriminate against rivals in favor of Google’s own ad tech business when it comes to third-party cookie alternatives.“We need to make sure that whatever we do does not result in us giving an unfair advantage or favoring our advertising business, and that’s the underlying constraint that dictates how we think about this,” Galbraith said.And that’s why engaging with the CMA and gathering feedback from the industry is “so valuable to us,” he said.“You can imagine an alternative world where we just, you know, did something without getting any feedback and just launched it into the world,” Galbraith said. “And that’s pretty close to the opposite of the approach that we’ve taken here.”",0.11504003,"topics 0.0404, floc 0.0198, google 0.0186, galbraith 0.0173, target 0.0109, test 0.0108, share 0.0095, base 0.0095, chrome 0.0095"
Jan-22,"Google's ""indecision"" over what system it wants to replace cookies has been criticised by some in the ad industry.It comes as the technology giant said an interest-based user-tracking system, Topics, would now replace its earlier proposal, Floc.One marketing executive said: ""This constant indecision does not inspire confidence.""Third-party cookies use people's browsing history to target ads that then follow them from site to site.Privacy advocates and regulators have increasingly fought against them.And Google has agreed to restrict their number on websites accessed via its Chrome browser, which commands about 65% of market share.It had originally planned to block them from this year but postponed the move until 2023.'Half-baked idea'Floc (Federated Learning of Cohorts) aimed to disguise users' individual identities by assigning them to a group, or flock, with similar browsing histories.But the idea was unpopular with both privacy advocates and advertisersFarhad Divecha, founder of digital marketing agency AccuraCast said it ""didn't make sense to most advertisers, who aren't technical data analysts"".""The system was met with a lot of criticism when Google launched it,"" he said, ""and it largely felt like a half-baked idea Google prematurely pushed out the door in response to changes in advertising and privacy.""""The past year has made it fairly clear that Google still aren't really sure of the best way forward.""Sensitive interestsIn a blogpost, Google confirmed Floc would now be replaced by Topics, a similar system that would group users in topic clusters, selected out of about 350 categories such as fitness or travel.Topics pinpoints users' interests and stores these for three weeks before deleting them.When someone visits a website, Topics will show the site and its advertising partners three of their interests from the previous three weeks.But it would not share sensitive interests, such as gender or race, Google said.Target usersAnd users would be able to remove ones they did not like - or disable the feature entirely.But one advertising-technology company questioned how Topics would help advertisers better target users.""Google's latest proposal on Topics is limited to one channel - its Chrome browser - and can't be applied to the multiple devices the majority of consumers use to access the open internet,"" The Trade Desk UK vice-president Phil Duffield said.""This means that advertisers are restricted to basic targeting approaches.""'Lip service'Meanwhile, Bennet Cyphers, of the Electronic Frontiers Foundation, told The Verge while better than Floc, Topics would ""still tell third-party trackers what kind of sites you browse"".And privacy-focused browser Brave, which has 50 million active users, said Google's change of plan was really just more of the same.""The Topics API [application programming interface] is, at root, the same idea as Floc,"" wrote the company's director of privacy, Peter Snyder.""In both proposals, the browser watches the sites you visit, uses that information to categorise your browsing interests, and then has the browser share that info back with advertisers.""And it was not up to Google to be ""the arbiter of what users consider 'sensitive' data"".""People should decide what they consider sensitive - not Google,"" Mr Snyder said.And Google's efforts were simply ""paying lip service to protecting the open web"" while maintaining their dominance.",0.170663265,"google 0.0329, topics 0.0218, would 0.0196, users 0.0193, privacy 0.0142, interest 0.0142, floc 0.0141, browser 0.0141, idea 0.0116"
Jan-22,"If you’re part of a business or school that is a G Suite legacy free edition user, your organization will soon have to sign up for a paid subscription to continue using Google Workspace (via 9to5Google). Google will automatically upgrade free plans to a Google Workspace subscription “based on the features you currently use” if your organization doesn’t sign up for a paid plan by May 1st.The free edition was initially available in Google’s first iteration of Workspace, called Google Apps, which launched in 2006. Google Apps rebranded as G Suite in 2016, before becoming the Google Workspace we know today in 2020 by bundling Gmail, Docs, Meet, Sheets, and Calendar along with some extra perks. Google stopped offering the legacy free edition as of December 2012 but still allowed existing users to access its services for free as a courtesy. Unfortunately, it looks like this grace period has finally come to an end.According to Google, the company is giving legacy free edition users until May 1st to sign up for a subscription, which consists of four tiers; otherwise, Google will choose a plan that suits users’ needs based on the features they use. There’s no option for a free plan, with only some educational institutions and non-profit organizations eligible for a plan at no cost.Administrators will have until July 1st to enter payment information into Google (if they haven’t already), and Google won’t start charging a subscription fee until July 1st. If no payment information is entered, Google will suspend the account for 60 days, after which users won’t be able to access Workspace’s “core services,” like Gmail, Calendar, and Meet.

Jan-22,"Meta may be the loudest company building AR and VR hardware. Microsoft has HoloLens. Apple is working on something, too. But don’t count out Google.The search giant has recently begun ramping up work on an AR headset, internally codenamed Project Iris, that it hopes to ship in 2024, according to two people familiar with the project who requested anonymity to speak without the company’s permission. Like forthcoming headsets from Meta and Apple, Google’s device uses outward-facing cameras to blend computer graphics with a video feed of the real world, creating a more immersive, mixed reality experience than existing AR glasses from the likes of Snap and Magic Leap. Early prototypes being developed at a facility in the San Francisco Bay Area resemble a pair of ski goggles and don’t require a tethered connection to an external power source. Google’s headset is still early in development without a clearly defined go-to-market strategy, which indicates that the 2024 target year may be more aspirational than set in stone. The hardware is powered by a custom Google processor, like its newest Google Pixel smartphone, and runs on Android, though recent job listings indicate that a unique OS is in the works. Given power constraints, Google’s strategy is to use its data centers to remotely render some graphics and beam them into the headset via an internet connection. I’m told that the Pixel team is involved in some of the hardware pieces, but it’s unclear if the headset will ultimately be Pixel-branded. The name Google Glass is almost certainly off the table, thanks to the early blowback (remember “Glasshole?”) and the fact that it technically still exists as an enterprise product.Project Iris marks a return to a hardware category that Google has a long and checkered history in. It started with the splashy, ill-fated debut of Google Glass in 2012. And then a multi-year effort to sell VR headsets quietly fizzled out in 2019. Google has since been noticeably silent about its hardware aspirations in the space, instead choosing to focus on software features like Lens, its visual search engine, and AR directions in Google Maps. Meanwhile, Mark Zuckerberg has bet his company on AR and VR, hiring thousands and rebranding from Facebook to Meta. “Metaverse” has become an inescapable buzzword. And Apple is readying its own mixed reality headset for as soon as later this year.Project Iris is a tightly kept secret inside Google, tucked away in a building that requires special keycard access and non-disclosure agreements. The core team working on the headset is roughly 300 people, and Google plans to hire hundreds more. The executive overseeing the effort is Clay Bavor, who reports directly to CEO Sundar Pichai and also manages Project Starline, an ultra-high-resolution video chat booth that was demoed last year.f Starline is any indication, Project Iris could be a technical marvel. People who have tried Starline say it’s one of the most impressive tech demos ever. Its ability to recreate who you’re chatting with in 3D is supposedly hyper-realistic. In an eye-tracking test with employees, Google found that people focused roughly 15 percent more on who they were talking to using Starline versus a traditional video call and that memory recall was nearly 30 percent better when asked about the details of conversations. I’ve heard that Google is hoping to ship Starline by 2024 along with Iris. It recently hired Magic Leap’s CTO, Paul Greco, to the team in a previously unreported move. A pilot program for using Starline to facilitate remote meetings is in the works with various Fortune 500 companies. Google also wants to deploy Starline internally as part of its post-pandemic hybrid work strategy. A big focus for Starline is bringing the cost of each unit down from tens of thousands of dollars. (Like Iris, there’s a chance that Google doesn’t meet its target ship year for Starline.)Bavor has managed Google’s VR and AR efforts for years, dating back to Google Cardboard and Daydream, a VR software and hardware platform that came out around the same time as the Oculus. He is a close friend of Pichai who has been at Google since 2005. Last November, he was given the title VP of Labs, a remit that includes Project Starline, Iris, a new blockchain division, and Google’s in-house product incubator called Area 120. At the time of his promotion, Google reportedly told employees that the Labs team is “focused on extrapolating technology trends and incubating a set of high-potential, long-term projects.”Some of the other leaders working on Project Iris include: Shahram Izadi, a senior director of engineering who also manages Google’s ARCore software toolkitEddie Chung, a senior director of product management who previously ran product for Google LensScott Huffman, the VP and creator of Google AssistantKurt Akeley, a distinguished engineer and the former CTO of the light-field camera startup LytroMark Lucovsky, Google’s senior director of operating systems for AR who was recently in a similar job at MetaGoogle’s interest in AR dates back to Glass and its early investment in Magic Leap. I’ve heard that the calculus for the Magic Leap investment was to have optionality to buy the company down the road if it figured out a viable path to mass-market AR hardware. In a 2019 interview, Bavor said, “I characterize the phase we’re in as deep R&D, focused on building the critical Lego bricks behind closed doors.” A year later, Google bought a smart glasses startup called North that was focused on fitting AR tech into a pair of normal-looking eyewear.Most of the North team still works at Google. A recent slew of job postings related to waveguides — a display technology more suited for AR glasses rather than an immersive headset like Project Iris — suggests they could be working on another device in Canada. Google declined to comment for this story.Last October, Pichai said on an earnings call that Google is “thinking through” AR and that it will be a “major area of investment for us.” The company certainly has the cash to fund ambitious ideas. It has top technical talent, a robust software ecosystem with Android, and compelling products for AR glasses like Google Lens. But it’s still unclear if Google plans to invest as aggressively as Meta, which is already spending $10 billion per year on AR and VR. Apple has thousands working on its headset and a more far-out pair of AR glasses.

Jan-22,"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai were allegedly aware of and approved a deal to collaborate on the potential manipulation of advertising sales, according to newly revealed documents.The documents, which came to light on Friday, were filed as part of a lawsuit against Google brought by the attorneys general of multiple US states. The lawsuit was first filed in December 2020 and claimed Google misled publishers and advertisers about the price and process of advertising auctions. At that time, many documents and parts of the lawsuit were redacted, but court rulings have since made them public.The lawsuit alleges that Google maintained control over the advertising sales market – a market that it dominates – by inflating the price of advertisements for brands and suppressing competition from other advertising exchanges.According to the Wall Street Journal, the complaint alleges that “Google pocketed the difference between what it told publishers and advertisers that an ad cost and used the pool of money to manipulate future auctions to expand its digital monopoly”. The documents further cite internal messages in which Google employees said it was like they were using “insider information” to grow the business.The Journal reported the lawsuit also claims executives at both Facebook, which recently rebranded as Meta, and Google signed off on a deal to allegedly assure that Facebook would bid on, and win, a certain percentage of ads.According to the lawsuit, Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, was “explicit that ‘this is a big deal strategically’” in a 2018 email thread about the deal that included Facebook’s CEO.When the two sides hammered out the terms of the agreement, “the team sent an email addressed directly to CEO” Zuckerberg, the lawsuit states.If Pichai is found to have personally approved the deal, he may be found to be complicit in the expansion of Google’s monopoly over the advertising market through manipulation. A Google spokesperson told the AP that while the deal was not a secret, it was inaccurate to say that Pichai approved it.“We sign hundreds of agreements every year that don’t require CEO approval, and this was no different,” the spokesperson said.In a statement, Google spokesperson Peter Schottenfels said the lawsuit is “full of inaccuracies and lacks legal merit”.Meta spokesperson Chris Sgro said Friday that the company’s ad bidding agreement with Google and similar agreements it has with other bidding platforms “have helped to increase competition for ad placements”.“These business relationships enable Meta to deliver more value to advertisers while fairly compensating publishers, resulting in better outcomes for all,” Sgro said.The new details come as the tech companies face mounting scrutiny over allegedly anti-competitive practices. A US judge ruled earlier this week that the government can proceed with a lawsuit that seeks to break up Meta, the parent of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, in an effort to loosen its grip on the market. And on Friday, a group of nearly four dozens states asked to reinstate a separate antitrust lawsuit against the company.Google, meanwhile, is facing its own monopoly-related charges brought by the US government.

Jan-22,"Alphabet Inc-owned (GOOGL.O) Google said on Tuesday its cloud division had acquired Israeli cybersecurity startup Siemplify, as the U.S. tech giant expands its security offerings amid rising cyber attacks.Financial details of the deal were not disclosed by the companies, but a source familiar with the matter said Google paid about $500 million in cash for Siemplify.The deal came after Google made a pledge to U.S. President Joe Biden last August to invest $10 billion in cybersecurity over the next five years, amid a significant rise in cyber attacks and data breaches.Siemplify, led by co-founder and chief executive Amos Stern, provides security orchestration, automation and response solutions. It has raised $58 million from investors including G20 Ventures and 83North.With a partnership with Google Cloud, Siemplify attracted the buyer's interest as it was in the process of raising a new round of private capital, the source added.Since the pandemic started in 2020, Google's revenue from the cloud business has nearly doubled to around $5 billion as companies shifted to working from home. The need to protect and hedge against security threats has shot up in tandem, with big corporates also beefing up on cybersecurity products.Google said Siemplify's platform would be integrated into its cloud and serve as the foundation for the capabilities it will invest in.The buyout, Google's first Israeli cybersecurity firm deal, will help the tech giant take advantage of the Middle Eastern nation's deep pool of cybersecurity talent.Guggenheim Securities advised Siemplify on the transaction.",0.055757576,"google 0.0332, siemplify 0.0317, cybersecurity 0.0290, cloud 0.0228, deal 0.0162, billion 0.0138, security 0.0136, million 0.0126, invest 0.0123"
Jan-22,"A judge has ordered Google to turn over hundreds of internal documents — many related to its efforts to quash an employee union — as part of a National Labor Relations Board case over the tech giant’s firing of former employees.In 2019, a group of workers who had recently been fired from Google (GOOGL GOOGLE) filed unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB, claiming they had been fired for speaking out about the company’s practices, such as signing controversial government contracts, and for engaging in protected labor organizing. Google (GOOGL GOOGLE) has maintained that the employees were let go for repeated violations of its policies. But in 2020, the NLRB filed a complaint alleging Google (GOOGL GOOGLE) had violated labor laws with two of the firings, claiming it had unlawfully targeted and surveilled employees engaged in organizing activities.This latest ruling by administrative judge Paul Bogas, issued on Friday, marks a blow to Google in defending against the labor claims. It also comes as a larger battle heats up between big tech companies and their employees. Employees at Google and its parent, Alphabet, announced the launch of the Alphabet Workers Union, a minority union affiliated with the Communications Workers of America, last January, marking an historic step for the tech industry.In his ruling, Bogas said Google had wrongfully claimed that the documents, which were subpoenaed as part of the former employees’ case, were subject to attorney-client privilege or work product privilege, calling the company’s arguments “not persuasive” and “an overreach.”In a statement to CNN Business, Google spokesperson Jennifer Rodstrom said the company disagrees with the characterization of the documents.“The underlying case here has nothing to do with unionization, it’s about employees breaching clear security protocols to access confidential information and systems inappropriately,” the statement reads.Many of the nearly 200 documents relate to Google’s “Project Vivian,” the company’s “campaign to discourage employees from unionizing,” and its hiring of consulting firm IRI Consultants to help carry out the campaign, according to Bogas’ ruling. They include a document in which Google Director of Employment Law Michael Pfyl “describes Project Vivian as ‘the initiative to engage employees more positively and convince them that unions suck,’” and one in which it is proposed that Google attorney Christina Latta find a “respected voice to publish an OpEd outlining what a unionized tech workplace would look like” to discourage workers from Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon from pursuing unionization, according to the filing, the ruling states.“As we’ve stated, our teams engage with dozens of outside consultants and law firms to provide us with advice on a wide range of topics, including employer obligations and employee engagement,” Google’s Rodstrom said in the statement. “This included IRI Consultants for a short period. However, we made a decision in 2019 not to use the materials or ideas explored during this engagement, and we still feel that was the right decision.”Bogas took issue with Google’s claims that documents were subject to attorney-client privilege — something that can shield information from becoming public in court proceedings — simply because a lawyer had been cc’ed on the email, even if the message did not seek legal advice.“A company cannot cloak a document in privilege merely by providing a copy to counsel,” Bogas said in the ruling, adding that Google also waived attorney-client privilege with respect to many of the documents when it included IRI, a third party hired to help with campaign messaging, on the communications.The judge also denied Google’s claim that the documents were subject to attorney work product privilege — which can keep secret documents created by an attorney in anticipation of or preparation for litigation — arguing that there was not a clear threat of litigation at the time when Google’s Project Vivian campaign was created.“The Respondent cannot spin the mere fact of a nascent organizing effort among employees into ‘litigation’ — like straw spun into gold — that entitles it to cloak in privilege every aspect of its antiunion campaign,” Bogas said.Bogas ruled that Google must immediately turn over nearly all of the documents, save for a handful of exceptions wherein he found the claim of attorney-client privilege was valid, in response to the former employees’ subpoena. He also ordered a review of Google’s claims of privilege over another nearly 1,000 internal documents related to the case.",0.033249705,"google 0.0450, document 0.0249, employees 0.0228, privilege 0.0188, claim 0.0168, bogas 0.0148, attorney 0.0148, company 0.0128, rule 0.0127"
Jan-22,"A bipartisan group of attorneys general sued Google on Monday, alleging that the technology giant has used “dark patterns” and deceptive practices to track users’ physical location even when those users have made efforts to block Google from doing so.The parallel lawsuits by the District of Columbia, Texas, Indiana and Washington state zero in on Google’s collection of location data, which can be used to target advertising and build profiles on internet users.The DC Attorney General’s lawsuit alleges that since 2014, Google (GOOG) has made misleading public statements about how users can opt out of location tracking. Despite offering settings in users’ Google accounts that promised to restrict location data tracking, Google allegedly failed to mention how certain other settings — such as in individual apps or in other areas of Google’s settings panel — might continue to allow the tech giant to keep collecting location data unbeknownst to the user.According to the complaint, Google also allegedly tried to circumvent users’ expressed preferences with workarounds, such as using IP addresses to determine a user’s location or collecting location data via Google’s apps installed on mobile devices. The allegedly illegal behavior affects virtually all mobile users who interact with Google, according to the complaint, whether they own an Android device, an iPhone, a PC or a tablet.To facilitate its data collection, Google allegedly relied on “dark patterns” — subtle design choices intended to guide users toward adopting behavior favorable to Google.“Google makes extensive use of dark patterns,” the complaint reads, “including repeated nudging, misleading pressure tactics, and evasive and deceptive descriptions of location features and settings, to cause users to provide more and more location data (inadvertently or out of frustration).”In a statement Monday, Google spokesman José Castañeda said the lawsuits were based on “inaccurate claims and outdated assertions about our settings.”“We have always built privacy features into our products and provided robust controls for location data,” Castañeda said. “We will vigorously defend ourselves and set the record straight.”In 2019, Google launched a feature that would, if enabled, automatically delete account activity data after a certain period of time. The following year, Google said it would expand that feature by enabling it by default for all new accounts created on its platform. Monday’s lawsuits, however, target Google conduct that predates those changes.Earlier this year, a state judge in Arizona declined to issue summary judgement in a similar case brought by Arizona officials against Google, saying that it was not an “obvious and straightforward” conclusion that Google misled or deceived consumers.The lawsuit seeks an injunction blocking Google’s allegedly illegal conduct and disgorgement of profits linked to the allegedly misleading practices.",-0.034036797,"google 0.0603, location 0.0307, users 0.0277, data 0.0244, allegedly 0.0188, settings 0.0159, feature 0.0129, mislead 0.0129, track 0.0100"
